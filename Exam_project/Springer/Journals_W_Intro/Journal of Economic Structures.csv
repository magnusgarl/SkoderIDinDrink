1.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,03 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-2409-1-8,Observing evidence of insider trading in the Athens Stock Exchange,December 2012,Eleftherios Thalassinos,Dimitrios Maditinos,Athanasios Paschalidis,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Information about publicly traded securities which is not publicly available and has a substantial impact on the value of traded securities is referred to as ‘inside information.’ People having access to such privileged information are referred to as ‘insiders.’ Executives, managers, lawyers, accountants andemployees usually fall into this category of ‘primary insiders’ (IOSCO [2003], p. 7). Additionally, ‘secondary insiders’ (IOSCO [2003], p. 9) who acquire access to such privileged information accidentally or involuntarily may also fall into this category (Minenna [2003], p. 65). Transactions performed by insiders taking advantage of privileged inside information are referred to as ‘insider trading’ (Jaffe [1974]). In Greece, Law 3340/2005, which was established in compliance with the EU Directive 2003/6/EC, provides the legal framework against ‘market abuse’ caused by exploitation of ‘privileged information.’ Additionally, Ruling No. 3/347/12.7.2005 of the Hellenic Capital Market Commission dictates disclosure requirements of privileged information, lists of persons having access to privileged information and transaction details disclosure requirements. Such transactions should not be related to privileged information. However, the broad literature reveals that the potential profit from exploiting privileged information is far too great temptation to be measured easily with laws and regulations. During the 1980s, an increased effort was undertaken by the US authorities to restrict insider trading. Seyhun ([1992]) demonstrated that the enforcement of regulations did not have any impact on insider trading, not even momentarily when a new regulation was imposed (p. 171). Consistently with these results, Seyhun and Bradley ([1997], p. 211) find that insider trading takes places even after a company files for bankruptcy when someone would expect that such transactions would be scrutinized. However, there was a decrease in insider trading observed, just before earnings announcements and takeover announcements, presumably because both of these announcements had been at the epicenter of numerous court cases (Seyhun [1992], pp. 171–175). Legislators, regulators and market participants have set the conceptual boundaries of insider trading. However, when it comes to enforcing laws and regulations, the boundaries are often blurred. For instance, when a member of the board performs a transaction, declares it to the stock market authorities and after some time realizes profits based on privileged information, it is often very hard to prove intentional exploitation of inside information. Insiders often disguise their transactions by trading at apparently unrelated moments or even through proxies. In effect, most studies documenting the various aspects of insider trading are based on officially reported transactions. Moreover, reported transactions are analyzed in regard to some standard sets of information, like earnings announcements, changes in dividends, mergers, acquisitions or even fraud (e.g. Ke et al. [2003]; Seyhun and Bradley [1997]). There are though important pieces of information that may well have an impact on the value of a firm, like the hiring of a key employee, for instance, or a business agreement, but pass unnoticed. While it is evident that insiders can be all those who perform their transactions based on privileged information, research is mainly based on reported transactions. Insider trading is first of all a company-specific activity that eventually, through its extensive presence, turns into a market-wide phenomenon. So, this study aims at proposing a process and an environment suitable for observing severally stock performance that might be attributed to insider trading. The research approach that has been followed so far, to the extent it was able to be reviewed, is the selection of a specific type of event, like an increased dividends announcement or a merger announcement. Such an approach may be suitable when the effects of insider trading are studied on an aggregate basis. In a firm-specific examination, though, such an approach would probably narrow the scope of research by limiting the examined cases and by completely disregarding unannounced events or firm-specific events. As a result, this study’s objective is to construct the proposed environment around a process that can identify informationally significant events which thereafter may be used as the focal points for insider trading activity examination. The ground for the present study is the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) while it is carried out by utilizing previous research, publicly available sources of information and information technology.",1

Thanks to his contribution, complicated phenomena such as capital reversal, re-switching of production technique and so on are illuminated. His method has a wide range of applicability, and environmental issues are no exception to the analytical target, although it has not been pursued at length in the Sraffian framework. The purpose of this paper is to apply the method to the analysis of a waste management and recycling problem, which is one of the most important environmental issues. I demonstrate how the choice of technique between waste disposal and recycling affects the natural price formation of an economy, and how waste and secondary material become commodities (goods) or discommodities (bads) depending upon circumstances. I also show that the choice of technique in a market economy leads to the maximisation of per capita consumption as in the conventional model of a growing economy, if the profit rate equals the growth rate. Thus, it is shown that the golden rule of accumulation holds in this extended model. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that per capita consumption does not necessarily decrease as the growth rate increases. This is an anomaly which cannot be found in the economy where discommodities (bads) are not considered. Although I have mentioned that the Sraffian method is not utilised sufficiently for studying environmental problems, I do not necessarily mean that there has been no contribution made by the method to the field of environmental analysis. On the contrary, quite a few researchers have contributed to this field insofar as a pure theoretical feature is concerned. Let us briefly refer to some of their works which are directly related to the present paper. To the best of my knowledge, Franke ([1986]) is one of the first researchers who applied a Sraffian type of model to an environmental problem, although his model is so abstract that his work may not be regarded as being located in the stream of environmental economics. Yet, he abandons the free-disposal assumption and introduces a costly-disposal process in his paper. Apparently, this means that economic residuals, whether they be waste water, harmful gases, garbage or whatever, must be treated by a disposal process, and thus that he handles an environmental problem at an abstract level. England ([1986]) also extends a Sraffian type of model on a rather earlier stage of the research history in order to present a basic model for analysing environmental problems such as air pollution, waste discharge and so on, although his treatment of the problems is very abstract, too. Using a very simple model, he shows how regulation on the emission of economic residuals affects the distribution of income, and how this type of model can be widely applicable to environmental problems. Lager ([2001]) also tackles the costly-disposal problem in a more general framework. Elegantly using a linear complementarity theory, he shows that there exists a long-run equilibrium in a classical economics sense even if free disposal is restricted. A quite interesting aspect of his paper is that a distinction between commodities (goods) and discommodities (bads) is determined endogenously, so that materials become commodities (goods) or discommodities (bads) depending upon economic circumstances. Kurz ([2006]) tackles a similar issue from a different angle. He surveys the traditional theory of joint production, finding that the costly-disposal problem can be handled in economics of the classical tradition. He also emphasises that there is no a priori distinction between commodities (goods) and discommodities (bads). Hosoda ([2010c]) analyses the same problem as Lager ([2001]) in a slightly different framework. Though Lager is more loyal to the original Sraffa system in adopting the assumption that the requirements for use are given, Hosoda inclines more to the analytical style of the Sraffa-Leontief-von Neumann framework. Hence, consumption demand is supposed to be dependent upon prices. As do other researchers, he demonstrates that the nature of a commodity (goods)/discommodity (bads) is determined endogenously in the model. All the works mentioned above are more or less theoretical studies. Whereas they have some important conclusions for understanding the relationship between an economy and an environment, it is not so easy to deduce a concrete policy implication from those works. Being based upon the basic Sraffian framework, Gehrke and Lager ([1995]) and Lager ([1999]) deduce quite an interesting result on environmental policy: they show that energy taxation may cause an increase in energy consumption. Although one might guess that such a perversity could happen in the economy where commodities are produced by means of commodities, they are the first to show rigorously that the perversity happens on certain conditions. Hosoda ([2010a]) also applies the Sraffian framework to a more concrete environmental issue, namely the problem of waste management and recycling. He demonstrates why an upstream policy such as extended producer responsibility should be adopted to reduce household waste. He fully utilises Sraffa’s idea on the distinction between basic and non-basic commodities and explains that such a policy is required only for household waste but not for industrial waste. Since this result shows the strength of the Sraffian analysis, let me briefly explain the essence of the argument. Household-waste treatment service corresponds to a non-basic commodity in the Sraffa’s sense, so that the technical condition of the service (which may be called a non-basic service), i.e. the waste treatment cost, does not affect the wage-profit frontier. Notice that the choice of technique is made depending upon the frontier in a long-run equilibrium. Thus, unless an upstream policy such as extended producer responsibility is introduced, a production process which creates more waste is adopted, since it never affects the frontier even if it is more costly. Once the policy is introduced, waste-disposal costs are counted as production costs by producers, and the treatment service turns to be a basic-commodity (basic-service), so that the wage-profit frontier reflects the technical condition of the service. If a production process which creates more waste on the post-consumption stage is more costly, it is never chosen in an equilibrium. The costs of industrial waste are, however, counted as part of production costs by producers, so that the waste treatment service of industrial waste is nothing but a basic-commodity (basic service), and affects the wage-profit frontier, insofar as the relevant commodity is basic. Thus, if a production process which creates more waste at the end of production is considered more costly by producers, it is never chosen in a long-run equilibrium. Hence, no upstream policy is required. The present study follows the spirit of the above study, applying a Sraffian type of model to a very realistic feature of a recycling society where waste is recycled and recycled materials (secondary resources) are used as downgraded resources. Insofar as I know, how downgrade recycling affects price formation and per capita consumption has not been explored in a growing economy so far. I believe that this is the very issue to which the analysis based upon the classical tradition could be applied. In the next section, the basic settings and assumptions are specified. In Section 3, the main results are presented. It is shown how waste and a secondary material become commodities (goods) or discommodities (bads) depending upon technological conditions and income distribution. It is also demonstrated that per capita consumption may not be a decreasing function of a growth rate when the rate is sufficiently small. The concluding remarks are given in the final section. Although I use a classical type of production model represented by a Sraffian model, I restrict our analytical framework to a more technologically specific one in order to make model building easier and clearer: a constant coefficient production model is adopted, and duality between price and quantity systems is emphasised. One more important feature of the present study is that most of the results are demonstrated by means of examples. Hence, mathematical deductions are relegated to the appendices.",

Nevertheless, so-called enterprise models have been constructed for more than 40 years (Farag [1967]). A true enterprise model is different from single-region input-output models where the inputs and outputs of a firm augment the table by one sector (Tiebout [1967]; Billings and Katz [1982]; Joshi [2001]). Rather, the firm is appraised as a system in its own right, and represented as a table distinguishing functional units of the firm as row and column sectors (Grubbstrom and Tang [2000]; Lave [2006]). Perhaps the most comprehensive and at the same time pioneering work is that of Polenske ([1997]), who demonstrated the usefulness of an enterprise input-output model that is embedded in the nested system of regional and national input-output tables. Since then, a number of interesting enterprise input-output models and their applications have been published worldwide (Correa and Craft [1999]; Marangoni and Fezzi [2002]; Li et al.[2008]; Lenzen et al.[2010a]), notably by Albino and colleagues (Albino et al.[2003]; Albino and Kühtz [2004]). Polenske’s basic idea was taken up again in recent input-output-based hybrid life-cycle approaches, where a so-called foreground system containing interdependent production processes is embedded in a national input-output table (Heijungs and Suh [2002]; Suh [2004]). Our work is about employing an enterprise model of the dairy industry in an assessment of life-cycle input coefficients of dairy products. Our approach is motivated by the fact that, given a growing population and demand for food and at the same time limited land resources for cultivation, the food sector - including the dairy industry - faces increasing pressure to move toward more resource-efficient production as measured in the context of life-cycle systems (Flysjö [2011]). Therefore, standards and guidelines have been developed (for example, ISO 14044 [2006]; IDF [2010]), and efforts have been made to quantify the resource and environmental impacts of the dairy industry (Berlin [2002]; Lundie et al.[2002]; de Vries and de Boer [2010]; Nilsson et al.[2010]). More recently, the industry and retailers have started to systematically quantify and publish the environmental impacts of their products. These industry activities have so far concentrated on carbon accounting, that is, carbon footprinting and carbon labeling (Carbon Disclosure Project [2011]). These carbon-related reporting and labeling activities are predominantly based on the methodology of life-cycle assessment (ISO 14044 [2006]). In particular, we investigate whether enterprise input-output approaches can be employed to deal with the multi-functionality issue in environmental Life-Cycle Assessment, which has been identified as a significant methodological problem (ISO 14044 [2006], Ciroth et al.[2008]). When assessing the environmental performance of products, the general situation is that most processes that constitute part of a production system are multi-functional: (1) they may produce more than one product (co-production), or (2) they may treat two or more waste inputs (combined waste treatment), or (3) they may treat one waste input and produce one valuable output. Combinations of these main types, involving three or more of the above basic functions on both the input and output side may also occur (Heijungs and Suh [2002]). Multi-functionality is especially present in dairy manufacturing systems. For example, the input of raw milk on a whole-of-plant basis needs to be allocated to the final products: skim milk powder, butter and buttermilk powder. ISO 14044 ([2006], Section 4.3.4) states that in all such cases the materials and energy flows as well as associated environmental releases shall be allocated to the different products according to clearly stated procedures. Several approaches for dealing with the multi-functionality problem have been developed, for example, through system boundary expansion and by allocation (or partitioning) using physicochemical, economic, mass and energy approaches (see, for example, Cederberg and Stadig [2003]; IDF [2010]; Feitz et al.[2007]; Weidema [2003, 2004]).",8

In terms of appropriation of resources (e.g. water, energy, land) for final demand categories, the models based on PIOTs are an alternative to the models based on ordinary monetary input-output tables (MIOTs). Hubacek and Giljum ([2003]) were the first to compare the results for the two models. When calculating land appropriation for exports, they found substantial differences and claimed that the use of PIOTs was more appropriate. This triggered a lively discussion along two different lines. The first focused on the treatment of waste in the model based on PIOTs and was able to explain a part of the differences (see Giljum and Hubacek [2004]; Giljum et al. [2004]; Suh [2004]; Dietzenbacher [2005]; and Dietzenbacher et al. [2009]). Still, the differences remained quite substantial. Using a highly aggregated 3-sector PIOT (in million tons) and MIOT (in billion DM) for Germany in 1990 (see Hubacek and Giljum [2003]), the land use (in 1,000 hectares) as embodied in exports was calculated. The percentage difference for the total land appropriation amounts to 6.4% (7,281.3 thousand hectares when the MIOT based model is used versus 6,845.8 when the PIOT based model is used). For the three underlying sectors, however, the results are quite dramatic. The percentage difference is 8.9% for the primary sector (MIOT: 6,339.3; PIOT: 5,822.4), 68.5% for the secondary sector (MIOT: 807.1; PIOT: 478.9) and −75.2% for the tertiary sector (MIOT: 134.9; PIOT: 544.5). The second perspective was put forward in Weisz and Duchin ([2006]). They convincingly argue that the differences are caused by the fact that the two types of input-output (IO) tables cannot be ‘translated’ into each other by using a single price for all the deliveries of a given sector (or industry). Instead, deliveries from sector i to sector j have a different price than deliveries from sector i to sector k or to the final demand categories. They calculate that the implicit prices of commodity outputs (in DM per ton) range from 0.02 to 0.27 for the primary sector, from 0.67 to 3.80 for the secondary sector, and from 5.31 to 163.09 for the tertiary sector. The same applies to IO tables in current and in constant prices. That is, sectors do not have a single price deflator that holds uniformly within a corresponding row of the IO table; rather, the intermediate deliveries require cell-specific deflators. This raises the question to what extent the results differ between using the model based on an IO table in current prices and the model based on an IO table in constant prices. The present paper addresses this question. In the next section, we will present the methods, one of which is novel. Section 3 discusses the results of an application using Denmark’s IO tables and Section 4 concludes.",19

Some pitfalls are avoided. First, market prices need not be perfectly competitive and, more generally, the observed allocation of resources may be inefficient. Solow’s ascription of TFP-growth to technical change holds in an idyllic neoclassical world where resources are rewarded according to their marginal productivities, but not beyond. Market power, managerial slacks and other sources of inefficiency abound and we must factor in their variations to properly account for performance changes. Since these conditions differ between industries, an input-output framework seems promising. The strategy of this paper is the following. I find it reasonable to assume that households are price takers. This point of departure is quite powerful, because the first order condition of the problem of the consumer, which equates the marginal rates of substitution to the price ratios, reveal that prices measure marginal utilities (up to an uninteresting multiplicative constant, the marginal utility of money) even when those prices are distorted. So I measure changes in the level of well-being of consumers by tracking final consumption. Then I use input-output analysis to decompose that bill of final goods and services. It may increase due to reductions in input coefficients, Solow’s technical change, but obviously for other reasons as well. This paper sorts it out.",1

For example, the environmental Kuznets curve describes an inverted-U relationship between economic growth (including structural changes) and environmental pollution (Grossman and Krueger [1991, 1995, 1996]; Carson [2010] for a literature overview). In particular, this article sheds light on the relationship between structural changes and environmental load in a specific country. As in Levinson ([2009]), I will focus on influences on CO2 emissions. In this study, I consider not only the economic scale, but also another factor that exhibits significant influence: changes in industrial composition. In Japan, the percentage of domestic Japanese production attributable to secondary industries (manufacturing), which exhibit high rates of CO2 emissions per unit production (i.e., large direct emissions coefficients), fell drastically, from 49 % in 1990 to just 39 % in 2005. In contrast, the percentage of domestic Japanese production attributable to tertiary industries (service industries), which exhibit low coefficients of direct CO2 emissions, rose significantly, from 48 % in 1990 to 60 % in 2005.Footnote 1 This also implies that Japan’s transition toward a service-oriented economy has contributed in reducing CO2 emissions, but the extent to which this has slowed the pace of global warming remains unclear. Important studies on the relationship between the transition to a service economy and CO2 emissions include those of Suh ([2006]) and Nansai et al. ([2009]). Suh ([2006]) demonstrated that household consumption of services, excluding electric utilities and transportation services, accounts for 37.6 % of total industrial GHG emissions in the United States. Nansai et al. ([2009]) analyzed the factors governing life-cycle CO2 emissions in Japanese service industries between the years 1990 and 2000 and concluded that increased inputs of energy and resources (including materials and components) led to significantly increased CO2 emissions. However, the studies of Suh ([2006]) and Nansai et al. ([2009]) did not quantify the transition to a service economy in terms of the increasing industrial composition attributable to service industries and also did not analyze the impact of the transition to a service economy on production-based CO2 emissions.Footnote 2 In addition, their studies did not argue that the transition to a service economy spurs an increase in imports of CO2-intensive commodities and that consequently this structural change contributes to global warming. Therefore, in the present study, I apply the Shapley–Sun additive decomposition method (Shapley [1953]; Sun [1998]) and decompose the change in production-based CO2 emissions from domestic industries into five components: that due to changes in the overall scale of the economy, that due to changes in the industrial composition of the various economic sectors, that due to energy intensity (i.e., technical) changes, which measures CO2 emissions per unit of domestic production, that due to changes in the import composition of the various commodities, and that due to changes in the import scale. Using this index decomposition method, I will analyze the impact of Japan’s transition to a service economy on Japanese CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2005, and finally argue the environmental benefits of its structural transition. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the decomposition method, Sect. 3 describes the data source, Sect. 4 presents a case study of Japan, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",17

Instead, large amounts of money are spent annually to stimulate production and consumption of conventional energy. Governments provide support either explicitly through subsidies or implicitly through interventions in energy prices and fuel allocation. Theoretically, subsidies could be justified if they increase overall social welfare. However, fossil-fuel subsidies are seen as having a net negative effect since they distort the economy and stimulate environmental deterioration (Ellis [2010]). Although in OECD countries energy subsidies have decreased considerably over the past two decades, subsidies are still pervasive in developing countries and transition economies (UNEP [2004]). Direct state support for energy sectors is not large in Ukraine compared to very high implicit subsidies due to under-pricing of energy products. Gas, electricity, and district heating tariffs for households are set by the state at very low rates, which do not reflect full costs for maintenance and capital investments (IEA [2006b]). Underpricing of energy distorts the economy of Ukraine and is one of the most important factors of its persistently high energy-intensity. As of 2009, it was at the level of 0.40 Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES)/GDP (ppp) (toe per 1000 USD at 2000 prices) compared to 0.37 for non-OECD Europe and Eurasia and a world average of 0.19TPES/GDP (ppp) (IEA [2011a]). Energy consumption is also responsible for a large share of GHG emissions of the country. In particular, GHG emissions from fuel combustion amounted to 240.6 million tons CO2-eq., i.e., 57 % of the total country emissions in 2008 (MENR [2010]). In the early 1990s, GHG emissions of the country had fallen drastically as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and resultant crash of the national economy with a GDP drop of about 50 % (SSCU [2009a]) in 1995 compared to 1990 levels. Nevertheless, Ukraine is among the top 20 largest CO2 emitters in the world (United Nations Statistics Division [2010]), with one of the highest carbon intensities of 0.89 kg CO2-eq/GDP (PPP), which is slightly higher than for non-OECD Europe and Eurasia, but almost twice as large as the world average (IEA [2011a]). Since the mid-1990s, the economy has gradually recovered and GHG emissions have started to rise. However, in situations of frequent political instability and heavy economic and social problems, environmental issues and climate change in particular are far from being a priority on the political agenda. A number of modeling studies show evidence that reduction or elimination of energy subsidies could bring environmental and economic gains (for a good review, see Ellis [2010]). Similarly, the IEA ([1999]) suggests that elimination of energy subsidies is likely to address all three dimensions of sustainable development. Environmental benefits would be obtained through efficient pricing leading to reductions of environmental pollution. Social welfare could be improved by redirecting public funds spent on subsidies toward social needs. Economic advantages could be derived from increased efficiency of resource allocation and reduced public expenditures. A number of studies have been undertaken to estimate environmental and economic impacts of phasing out energy subsidies in developing and transition economies (e.g., Saboochi [2001]; Saunders and Schneider [2000]; Lin and Jiang [2011]). However, according to our knowledge, no papers have previously analyzed the likely effects of the removal of end-user energy subsidies (i.e., energy price distortions) for the Ukrainian context. In addition, conclusions derived for Ukraine could also be relevant for other transition economies since the majority of post-Soviet countries inherited highly energy-intensive economies due to relative abundance of energy resources in the Soviet Union and state control of energy prices. Therefore, the objective of this study is to estimate end-user energy subsidies in gas and electricity sectors of Ukraine and assess environmental and socioeconomic effects of a hypothetical elimination of energy subsidies. The paper does not consider direct subsidies (i.e., direct payments made by the government) either to consumers or producers but focuses on implicit consumer subsidies following the definition and approach of the International Energy Agency ([1999]). We adopted a broad definition of energy subsidies as any government policies or measures could directly or indirectly influence prices or costs. These subsidies are estimated as a price-gap between actual prices and market prices, which would prevail in the absence of subsidies. In this paper, we focus only on consumer subsidies in electricity and gas sectors. Indirect consumer subsidies for the oil and coal sector are not considered since previous studies have shown that prices of oil products are close to market levels and consumer subsidies for coal did not take place in Ukraine (e.g., IEA [2006a, 2008, 2011b]). Section 2 provides an overview of the previous estimates of energy subsidies in Ukraine and reviews the literature for environmental and socioeconomic effects of a hypothetical subsidy reform. Section 3 elucidates theoretical underpinnings of the price-gap approach and input–output analysis, describes the data utilized in the analysis, and points out limitations of this paper. Section 4 presents the main findings of the study. Finally, conclusions and policy implications of the hypothetical energy subsidy reform are summarized in Sect. 5.",18

For example, manufacturers of turbine engines are selective about the performance of turbine blades, whereas producers of the blades focus on cost effectiveness that is better quality blades at lower costs. Similarly, the recycling industry will be affected by the recyclability of the secondary (recycled) inputs, which is controlled by the producers of primary products. The quality adjustment process described hereinafter is therefore somewhat in the same vein as the demand-driven technology evolution, as discussed in Adner and Levinthal ([2001]). Based on the Lancasterian consumer theory (Lancaster [1966]), quality is usually treated as the bundle of objective characteristics (attributes) of a commodity for which the consumer holds positive values.a This paper is concerned with commodities that are vertically differentiated by objective quality: In other words, better quality is preferred by all users (consumers) if the commodities are sold at the same price. For example, PCs with a fast processor and a relatively slow processor are vertically differentiated, whereas chocolate and vanilla ice cream are horizontally differentiated because they are equally priced.b Quality can be subject to externalities when product attributes lack their individual markets. Attributes generally do not retain the excludability property that a normal commodity has in theory due to their bundledness, rendering the independent coordination of attributes impractical. While excludability being one of the characteristic of a public good, Leland ([1977]) and Dreze and Hagen ([1978]) indicate that for quality choices, individuals’ private assessment (i.e., the Lindahl price) of attributes are needed when the implicit market of attributes is incomplete. Conversely, these studies claim that if every attribute’s implicit price spans the explicit competitive prices of goods, the (first-order) conditions for efficiency are met. This study focuses on cases in which the market of attributes forms an incomplete, non-spanning structure, and thus quality is partially or completely external to the economic coordination system. Given these circumstances, the study posits that producers follow a quality adjustment process based on trial-and-error, that is, they adjust the quality in accordance with demand in order to predominate the product market with improved quality. The idea is parallel to previous studies on dynamic search processes, such as Callander ([2011]) under conditions of uncertainty and Sato ([2012]) for public goods. Nevertheless, it was Jwa ([1985]) who studied quality development in vertically differentiated products, assuming the price of quality being available. Jwa ([1985]) also pointed out the reduction in variety by the nature of competitive equilibrium, resulting in a single homogeneous quality across products. Similar issues have been addressed in Nishimura ([2008]) about the quality of secondary materials in the recycling industry. More recently, from a slightly different perspectives, Brun and Pero ([2012]) analyzed a firm’s decision to reduce its variety of industrial products. Such a reduction in the vertically differentiated variety is essentially equivalent to being variety averse, discussed in a number of empirical studies (e.g., Levav et al. [2010]; Kaiser [2011]). The essential problem is that products need differentiation to enable the selection of a better quality product, while it is refused to diversify after one being selected.c In this paper, a model of quality adjusting process under non-spanning structure of implicit markets over the attributes is presented. Change in quality is controlled by the assumption that a competitive producer not only maximizes profit by taking the price of product, but also alters the quality (or that of the attributes) with the speculation that a product with a different quality (and corresponding price) can lead the market. The benchmark model deals with cases in which the buyer of a product is indifferent to the heterogeneity in product quality. The buyer chooses the quality altered product if the product with marginally altered quality is more valuable to him or her relative to the marginal cost of altering the quality, which the seller adds to the price of the product.d The new product will then dominate the market, thereby improving the quality in the market. The steady state of the benchmark process is shown to satisfy the necessary conditions of efficiency. However, this is not the case when heterogeneity in product quality matters to the buyer. For example, intermediate and recycling industries typically use bulky inputs for production, and thus consistent quality is often preferred. However, if the producer of an upper stream industry alternates the quality of its product, the lower stream industry would consequently face heterogeneous inputs. This study presents several cases of buyers’ preference for homogeneous/heterogeneous quality. It shows that even when products with varied quality are differently priced, the quality adjustment procedure may not function when the variety assessment of the buyer is non-smooth around the center. Cases where heterogeneous products are assessed with a flat price could lead to inefficiency because the smaller the producer, the more its effort become attenuated. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly specifies the spanning property in the implicit markets for attributes, and by doing so, focus on the equilibrium state of a non-spanning economy where some attributes are external to the economy. Section 3 outlines the foundations of the quality adjustment process driven by one of producers (a speculator) seeking alternating price-quality combinations in a non-spanning environment. Subsequently, the case of a consumer without distastes upon heterogeneous products is discussed. In Sect. 4, we consider cases where the consumer is variety averse, that is, the consumer/user prefers consistent product quality. Section 5 is devoted to demonstrating the results with a simple model of a recycling economy. Section 6 concludes.",

The indirect construction of a technical coefficients matrix essentially removes secondary activities from industries, and this procedure may create negative input coefficients. We review variants of this procedure and the ways negative coefficients are circumvented. Some farmers produce cheese as a secondary activity; the farmers’ input structure of their main activity is distorted by the inputs of cheese. These inputs must be removed somehow, shifted to the cheese industry. There are two removal procedures, employing the input structure of the farmers who produce cheese (admitting that cheese can be produced differently in different industries) or of the cheese manufacturing industry. The former option is denoted as the industry technology assumption, while the latter is denoted as the commodity technology assumption. This paper will give insight in the pros and cons of the two options. The next section introduces a common framework encompassing the commodity and industry technology assumptions and also identifies the former as theoretically superior according to the existent literature. However, Sect. 3 identifies sources of potential negative technical coefficients that plague the commodity technology assumption. In Sect. 4, we provide a comprehensive review of the procedures available in the literature to deal with these negatives, both for square and rectangular use and make tables. We conclude with some guidelines for economic modelers.",5

SAMs support the continuing need to use recent and consistent multisectoral economic data for policy analysis and the development of economy wide models (Robinson et al. [2001]). A SAM is an extended set of national accounts that disaggregates the value added in each production activity into payments to various factors such as land, labor, and capital, and disaggregates household incomes and expenditures according to various household types. Mathematically, a SAM is a square matrix in which each account is represented by a row and a column. Each cell shows the payment from the account of its column to the account of its row. Thus, the incomes of an account appear along its row and its expenditures along its column. The underlying principle of double-entry accounting requires that, for each account in the SAM, total revenue (row total) equals total expenditure (column total). Data typically used to build SAMs include an input–output (IO) matrix of the economy, national accounts, fiscal accounts, trade data, other balance-of-payments information, and surveys providing information on the composition of household income and expenditures. Given its ability to capture interindustry linkages and household income and expenditure composition while being consistent with macroeconomic accounts, a SAM can serve as a unique economic database for structural analysis. However, in order for academics to be able to fruitfully employ a SAM to perform up-to-date structural analysis, the SAM needs to provide rich and current detail on the income and expenditure patterns of the production sectors, production factors, and households of an economy: only a SAM with a rich disaggregation of accounts allows the heterogeneity of the income and expenditure composition among households to be reflected in a significant way and, as a result, allows the distributional effects of changes in the composition of output in the economy to be identified. This paper provides a model for future researchers looking to build a SAM and applies the model to Pakistan, creating a highly disaggregated and updated SAM. This SAM is then used to describe the structure of the Pakistani economy through multiplier analysis in an attempt to provide a useful reference and resource for academics concerned with the structure of Pakistan’s economy. The Pakistani economy has undergone marked changes during the last decade, which call for an updated countrywide database. In only 10 years, the share of the country’s service sector increased from 50.7 % (2000) to 54.6 % (2010); the share of the textile sector in total exports decreased from 64.8 % (2000) to 53.0 % (2010); and the labor force grew significantly, due not so much to the annual population growth rate of around 2 %, but more to an impressive increase in the labor participation rate, which though still low by international standards, grew from 28.9 % (2000) to 45.7 % (2010) (State Bank of Pakistan [2010]). Our paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we review past SAMs for Pakistan and highlight their relative strengths and weaknesses in capturing sector, factor, and household detail. In Sect. 3, we explain our approach to building a SAM and how we apply the model to Pakistan. Based on the resulting SAM, in Sect. 4 we analyze the structure of the Pakistani economy, and in Sect. 5 we conduct income multiplier analysis to further illuminate the economic structure of the country.

From the standpoint of new Keynesian economics, Greenwald and Stiglitz [8] as well as Bernanke and Gertler [3] pointed out that the investment and output of rational firms depend on the firms’ balance sheet factors under an imperfect capital market. It is hardly new to discuss the interactions between financial markets and the real economy. Keynes [10] rejected classical economics and indicated the instability of the real economy; especially, he emphasized the instability of financial markets. In general, a firm’s behavior depends not only on balance sheet factors, which new Keynesian pointed out, but also on bank behavior and other factors. Minsky [12] analyzed the effects of financial factors on the economy. He alleged that financial booms and collapses become inevitable in market economies. In this respect, he is in the post Keynesian group, which emphasizes instability of the economy. He investigated the financing of investments and the cyclical behavior of the real economy. He developed a new theory called the financial instability hypothesis, which involved the argument of Fisher [7] as well as Keynes. Minsky’s ideas lead to the development of various mathematical models.a For example, Taylor and O’Connell [15] and Adachi [1] focused on long-run expectations and household portfolios. Though Adachi constructed a model with explicit inclusion of bank behavior, his model is too complex to show concisely the dynamic economy and stabilizing effects of monetary policy. In this paper, we highlight net worth, which is line with new Keynesian theory. However, we focus on the net worth ratio, which is the ratio of net worth to capital of a firm. One of the purposes of this paper is to build a simple macro model on the net worth ratio from the standpoint of post Keynesian economics. We investigate financial factors, which give rise to instability of the economy. We formulate a model of investment decisions, bank behavior, and financing for better understanding of the relations between real economy and financial economy. Our model has assumptions that are similar to Greenwald and Stiglitz. The equity market is imperfect. Firms cannot raise new equity and normally pay a dividend on existing shares. Meanwhile, there is a bank lending market. The firms can borrow as much as they want, but they must pay interests. Hence, the evolution of net worth is represented by retained earnings. The second purpose of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy. We first construct a static model, and then extend to a dynamic model that incorporates dynamic equations of both the net worth ratio and bank lending rate.b This dynamic model is similar to that of Taylor and O’Connell and Adachi. We investigate the effects of monetary policy on the short-run and long-run equilibrium; especially, we consider a stabilizing effect of monetary policy when the steady state is unstable. Our results demonstrate that the economy can be unstable when the dividend rate is low and the bank’s lending reaction to the net worth ratio is more elastic than investment reaction. The latter factor is a feature of our model. When the steady state is a saddle point, the change in the basic discount rate is likely to shift the economy from an unstable path to a convergence path.c We can see that financial policy has a stabilizing effect in the long-run as well as a positive effect in the short-run. This paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents an overview of the model we are proposing. Section 3 discusses the respective behavior of firms, banks, and households. We derive the investment function, bank lending function, and so on. In Sects. 4 and 5, we consider the equilibrium of commodity market and bank lending market, respectively. Section 6 analyzes the equilibrium of the short-run economy. Section 7 investigates the instability of economy. We construct a dynamic system and consider a stabilizing effect of monetary policy. Finally, Sect. 8 summarizes the results.",

The capacity of input-output tables to reflect the structural peculiarities of the economy and to forecast, on this basis, its evolution, depends essentially on the characteristics of matrix A of I-O (or technical) coefficients. The so-called Leontief matrix [

] has proven to be a powerful analytical tool in the investigation of propagated effects induced by inter-industry production chains. Our paper utilises the methodological framework developed in [23, 24, 28, 41, 44]. The temporal behaviour of I-O coefficients is yet an open question. In most applications, the stability of matrix A is usually assumed. This comes from both classical and extended interpretations of the Cobb–Douglas production function. According to Sawyer (p. 327 in [38]), “Under the first of these alternative hypotheses, the 
a
ij
 will be stable in volume terms. Under the second, the 
a
ij
 will be stable in value terms”. Generally, the relative stability of the technical coefficients can be considered as a reasonable assumption for a short-medium term. In the case of longer intervals, the question is much more complicated. 2. We shall empirically discuss this problem by using Romanian input-output tables. Our statistical option was motivated inter alia by the existence of official annual data for two decades (1989–2009). These tables are built on an extended classification comprising 105 branches [17]. To simplify computational operations, the present research relates to a more compact version of 10 sectors [11, 33], as described in Table 1. The correspondence of this collapsed structure to the original extended nomenclature is detailed in [12]. As in any aggregation, the one proposed in Table 1 implies some losses of information. Nevertheless, the chosen analysis classification remains sufficiently complex and relevant to involve in this discussion some conceptual anchors of chaos theory. Specifically, we investigate whether the I-O coefficients series could contain sets of attractor points. To answer this question, a methodology for their numerical estimation will be applied to the available data. 3. The robustness of structural changes analysis and of the sectoral dynamic general equilibrium models depends mainly on the temporal behaviour of I-O coefficients. These can be estimated: • in volume terms (at constant prices), denoted as 
ca
ij
; and • in value terms (at current prices), usually denoted as 
a

. The first estimation concerns the real economy, while the second relates to the nominal one. These determinations are mediated by the relative prices (

2.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,04 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-2409-2-1,Key Sectors of the Namibian Economy,December 2013,Michael N Humavindu,Jesper Stage,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The purpose of this paper is to determine the key productive sectors for the Namibian economy. The principal concern with a key sector analysis is the identification of economic activities that exhibit the largest amount of interdependence with the rest of the economy. Such interdependence is usually measured through either backward or forward linkages. Backward linkages pertain to the dependence of a given economic activity on inputs produced from other activities, whilst forward linkages relate to a given economic sector’s role in supplying inputs to other sectors. The overall concern with the identification of key sectors is their usefulness in economic development strategy. Since key sectors have high backward and forward linkages with the rest of the economy, investment in these sectors is expected to enhance economic development prospects [6, 7, 14]. Despite the usefulness of identifying key sectors, especially for development planning, key sector analysis has not been widely used in developing countries in recent years. Indeed, most recent studies have been in developed countries. Part of the reason for this low level of use is perhaps the considerable data requirements: even a basic key sector analysis requires an input–output table, which is only compiled every ten years or so (if at all) by most developing countries. In addition, more extensive analyzes such as the one presented here require employment data, which are often lacking in developing countries. Moreover, many developing countries are capital scarce and cannot easily support investment in key sectors even if such sectors are identified, making them less interesting from a policy perspective. However, key sector analysis remains a useful tool in those countries where the necessary data and the necessary funding are available. This study presents the first set of key sector analyzes for the Namibian economy. Namibia is located in southern Africa. It has 2.1 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product (GDP) of approximately US$12.5 billion, with per capita annual income registered at almost US$6,000. It is classified as a lower-middle-income country [2, 17]. Yet Namibia has one of the most unequal income distributions on the African continent, with a Gini coefficient of 0.63. Unemployment (estimated at 36.7 % and 52 % of the labor force in 2004 and 2008, respectively), poverty (56 % of the population live on less than US$2 a day) and household food security are major challenges faced by the country. The Namibian economy is dualistic in character as it comprises a modern market sector based on capital-intensive industry and farming, producing most of the country’s wealth, and a traditional subsistence farming sector. The Namibian economy has a high degree of openness as the sum of exports and imports equates to more than 90 % of GDP. Most raw material commodities are exported in unprocessed or semi-processed form, and many consumer goods are imported. Agriculture has a small contribution to GDP (around 5 %), but it employs about 30 % of the total labor force. The largest part of the economic contribution from agriculture is from relatively large, commercial farms, but traditional subsistence farming remains crucial for supporting a large share of the population. About 70 % of the population depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood. An important structural feature of the economy is the positive current account balance offset by a deficit on the capital and financial account. This reflects a chronic excess of savings over investment in the economy, thereby making Namibia a net exporter of capital. This means that, unlike the situation in many other developing countries, Namibia is not capital-scarce per se; if interesting investment opportunities are available, the country has funding available through its own domestic savings. This means that there is scope for policies to support the development of key sectors once these have been identified. Namibia’s new development policy frameworks (the Industrial Policy 2012 and the Fourth National Development Plan) are premised on a targeted sectoral approach. Unlike in the past, where the government attempted to develop all sectors, sector identification and selection is now paramount. The sectors selected for the new growth strategy are manufacturing, transport, logistics and mineral processing. These are perceived to be sectors in which the country has a comparative advantage as well as growth potential. The selection of sectors for development also has a direct bearing on the deployment or direction of flow of instruments such as economic incentives as well as government research and development (R&D). The country is also busy finalizing an Investment Bill that aims to help attract both foreign and domestic investment in key economic sectors. However, these sectors were mainly singled out as important for economic development based on consultations with stakeholders; no major assessment has been undertaken thus far in terms of a key sector analysis. Thus, an analytical exercise in identifying key sectors for the Namibian economy could help ensure that the new development approach to be adopted is grounded in economic reality.",15

In earlier studies, for example, John and Pecchenino ([1994]), John et al. ([1995]), and Bovenberg and Heijdra ([2002]) extend the model of Diamond’s ([1965]) OLG model and examine the relation between growth and the environment. Stokey ([1998]), Aghion and Howitt ([1998]) also examine the relation between economic growth and the environment.Footnote 1These studies assume that the government is altruistic. Results obtained using such models suggest that environmental externalities should be internalized by environmental policies. These studies do not consider politico-economic problems. Moreover, the assumption that the government implements appropriate policies might be overly optimistic. Bribes, political donations, and corruption might taint and skew government policy. Negotiation and compromise between parties might occur when the government executes policies. Furthermore, not only government but also the private sector might use political power to head off the introduction of strict environmental policies if such policies reduce their profits.Footnote 2 In this paper, we will consider how political corruption affects economic growth and the environment. To highlight the dynamic features of economic activities, we use the ideas of human capital. Human capital accumulation is one of the most important factors when we consider long-run growth (Lucas [1988]). Some insist that R&D and innovation exert an important role in long-run growth (Romer [1990]; Aghion and Howitt [1992]). We can construct a growth model with R&D and innovation instead of human capital. However, we can derive similar results even if we introduce R&D. So, we assume that human capital accumulation becomes an engine of productivity improvement. Lopez and Mitra ([2000]) consider the relation between pollution and growth. The amounts of donations and pollution level (environmental standard) are determined endogenously through a process of bargaining between the government and the firm. They show that corruption does not affect the sustainability of economic growth, although the economy emits more pollution than under the social optimum. Our model might be interpreted as an extension of Lopez and Mitra ([2000]). A salient difference is that we construct a dynamic OLG model rather than a static model (Lopez and Mitra [2000] construct a static model). By constructing an OLG model, we can derive the different results from Lopez and Mitra ([2000]). It can be demonstrated that corruption relaxes environmental standards and lowers the long-run growth rate. Results show that the growth rate might become zero or negative if the government and/or public sector are corrupt to such a degree. Our paper specifically examines the case in which the government colludes with the entrepreneur. Their utility will increase at the expense of the laborer. In this sense, an implicit conflict exists between entrepreneurs and laborers.Footnote 3 This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the basic setting of this paper is described. In Sect. 3, we consider environmental policy. In Sect. 2 and Sect. 3, we do not take bribes or political donations into consideration. In this case, the long-run growth rate becomes positive and the environment improves over time if certain conditions are met. In Sect. 5, problems related to political corruption are introduced. The entrepreneurs offer political donations to the government if such donations can increase their profits to a great extent. However, the government accepts donations if the net benefit of taking political donations is positive. We assume that the amount of donations and the pollution level (environmental standards) are determined endogenously through a process of bargaining between the government and the entrepreneur. In this case, the government and the firm try to arrive at a cooperative outcome through mutual agreement. We show that this interlocking relation between entrepreneurs and government lowers the growth rate. The economy might stagnate if the economy is heavily tainted by corruption.",2

Agriculture employs most of the labor in DRC and produces the largest percentage of total value added. Figure 1 shows that agriculture employs 60.2 percent of the Congolese labor force and generates about 21 percent of total value added. Sectors such as textiles, chemicals, construction, and forestry only produce a small share of value added and contribute marginally to employment creation. Figure 1 further indicates that agriculture and trade sectors lie below the 45-degree line, meaning that the share of employment in these sectors is higher than the share of value added from these sectors. However, the largest gap between the contribution to value added and employment appears to be in agriculture. This indicates that agriculture has the lowest productivity in DRC’s economy. Profile of sectoral employment and value added (2005). Source: Author’s based on DRC national accounts (2005) Agriculture is the most unproductive sector in DRC because of inconsistent and uncoordinated agricultural development strategies, coupled with conflict and the progressive withdrawal of the government from supporting agricultural activities. According to Otchia ([2013b]), government policy implemented since 1966 led to the collapse of large-scale commercial agriculture, favored subsistence agriculture, and distorted economic incentives against agriculture. In addition to this, the government removed all subsidies and price support measures to agriculture in 2002. Consequently, farmers use a rudimentary agricultural technology mostly based on outdated production methods and inputs. Agriculture also faces high transaction costs due to the lack of infrastructure most of which was destroyed during political conflicts. Low productivity in agriculture entails unstable and low paid jobs. As a result, an overwhelming proportion of agricultural workers are poor. Four out of every five rural poor work in agriculture. In urban areas, agriculture accounts for one-third of the poor. Nevertheless, agriculture is still attracting labor in both urban and rural areas. According to Herderschee et al. ([2012]), agriculture provided employment for 10 million people in 2005 and 15 million in 2010. Despite the low productivity, labor accrues in agriculture because it can produce the amount of food necessary for their subsistence. This implies that most of the farming activities are of a small scale and aim to increase food security. Given its low productivity, increasing the amount of labor and land is the only way to raise production in agriculture. Labor flows to subsistence farming as it uses essentially manual work, whereas large-scale farmers tend to expand land. Indeed, DRC is far from reaching the agriculture frontier, as it uses only 11 percent of the 80 million hectares of arable non-forest land for agriculture. However, in recent years, much of agricultural land has been developed for export-oriented large-scale commercial agriculture.Footnote 1These agricultural investments are made by foreign investors to secure their own food needs. This constrains access to land for small-scale farmers. Against this background, agricultural productivity improvement is the fundamental policy to initiate agricultural transformation and raise income of the poor (Alvarez-Cuadrado and Poschke [2011]; Ngai and Pissarides [2007]). The reason is that productivity improvement “pushes” labor out of agriculture and increases farmers’ real wages; “pulls” jobs in sectors that use agriculture as inputs; and increase supply of affordable food in the economy. The empirical literature reports strong and robust effects of agriculture productivity on poverty (Thirtle et al. [2003]; Irz et al. [2001]; de Janvry and Sadoulet [2010]). However, the magnitude of poverty reduction due to agricultural productivity growth varies largely across countries, depending on the way they developed and used new technologies (de Janvry and Sadoulet [2010]). The literature documents a range of policies to increase agriculture productivity and enhance income-increasing structural change.Footnote 2Among them, technological change has been acknowledged as the principal driver of productivity growth (OECD [2012]; Morris et al. [2007]; DFID [2006]). However, it is worth mentioning that the innovation, selection, and adoption of new technologies depend on the agriculture frontier, factor endowment, and market imperfections. Hayami and Ruttan ([1970]) used data on agriculture inputs to assess how endowment drove the direction of technical change in the US and Japan during 1880–1960. They found that land abundance in the US favored labor-saving technological change while the land scarcity in Japan led to the development and adoption of land-saving technologies. As a mechanization strategy, labor-saving technological change consists of using tractors and machinery, whereas land-saving technological change focuses on biological and chemical innovations. A recent successful case of land-saving technological change occurred during the Green Revolution in Asia. The Green Revolution was an intensifying of input-based production characterized by the use of high-yielding and fertilizer-efficient new varieties of seed (rice and wheat). Policymakers initiated this type of agricultural transformation to increase food production and reduce hunger and malnutrition in the 1960s. Hence, it is conceptually clear that the Green Revolution increased agriculture and food production. Empirical results also indicate that it led to poverty reduction as it raised farmers’ income and increased food affordability. Though it is expected that agricultural productivity improvement tends to reduce poverty, the extent to which it reduces inequality and benefits small-scale farmers is still open to question. For instance, the pro-poorness of the Green Revolution has been disputed, since its effectiveness in reducing inequality is not straightforward. The main argument states that the Green Revolution worsened income distribution as it was biased in favor of larger farmers and missed the poorer subsistence small-scale farmers (Das [1998]; Griffin [1979]; Freebairn [1995]; Goldman and Smith [1995]). Furthermore, it increased landless farmers and the demand for unskilled labor, which in turn lowered wage laborers (Hazell and Ramasamy [1991]; Glaeser [1987]; Cleaver [1972]). Despite this, the experience of Asia points to a clear consensus on the role of strong public policies and investment in creating a pro-poor Green Revolution (Eicher [1995]; Smale [1995]; Hazell [2009]). These policies include agricultural research and development, irrigation, rural roads, access to credit, and price support policies. In addition, those policies had been successful when they have been implemented together. However, there is no empirical assessment on the pro-poorness of technological change and the complementary rural development policies in Africa, especially in DRC. This paper thus aims to assess what are the better and worse models for agricultural modernization in DRC. Agricultural transformation is qualified as a better model only if it is centered on small-scale farmers as most of them are poor and have limited resource endowment relative to other farmers. To put it differently, a better model for agricultural modernization produces pro-poor effects where poor households gain relative to the richer ones. Several recent studies have looked at the pro-poor effects of policies, particularly using CGE-microsimulation model (Boccanfuso et al., [2011], [2013a], [2013b]; Annabi et al. [2008]; Ravallion and Lokshin [2008]). Most of the studies do not show factors behind the differences in the impacts of policy on pro-poor growth or decompose the changes in poverty into growth and distribution components, but rather show how poor benefit/lose relative to rich segments of the population. Boccanfuso and Kaboré ([2004]), however, did find that the relationship between poverty, growth, and inequality relationship is heterogeneous and conditional on context. To look at the pro-poorness of different strategies for modernizing agriculture, I combine three techniques, namely a computable general equilibrium model, a household-survey based microsimulation, and least square regressions. I adopt a sequential approach that can be described in four steps. In the first step, I evaluate the effects of agricultural modernization strategies on employment, wages, and rents, and the price of goods and services. I use a CGE-microsimulation model that captures various links through which agricultural modernization affects households. These links include the return to labor and land, the price of goods, the impact on non-agriculture sector, and sectoral labor mobility. Then I feed the changes from the CGE model into a microsimulation model, which takes into account household heterogeneity in terms of factor endowments and consumption patterns, to generate welfare gains or losses at the household level. Using these welfare changes, in the third step I apply the pro-poor growth framework to assess which of the agricultural modernization strategies is pro-poor and the extent to which growth and redistribution contribute to welfare changes, following Annabi et al. ([2008]). Finally, I select a strategy that produced pro-poor welfare gains in the previous stage, and use a least square regression as in Ravallion and Lokshin ([2008]) to quantify the determinants of pro-poor agricultural modernization at the household level. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the agricultural sector in DRC. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework of agricultural modernization, while Sect. 4 explains the features of the CGE-microsimulation model and presents an analytical framework for pro-poor analysis. Section 5 discusses and presents the results of policy experiments. Finally, Sect. 6 provides a summary of the results and lessons for policymakers.",10

Although primitive and using only the demand point of view, Samuelson’s prospect still provides an excellent insight into the problem and justification of business cycles appearing in national economies. In the past decades, many more sophisticated models have been proposed by other researchers; see Chari ([1994]), Chow ([1985]), Dassios and Kontzalis ([2012]), Dassios et al. ([2012]), Dassios and Kalogeropoulos ([2014]), Dassios and Zimbidis ([2014]), Day ([1999]), Puu et al. ([2004]), Rosser ([2000]), Westerhoff ([2006]), Wincoop ([1996]). All these models use superior and more delicate mechanisms involving monetary aspects, inventory issues, business expectation, borrowing constraints, welfare gains, and multi-country consumption correlations. Some of the previous articles also contribute to the discussion for the inadequacies of Samuelson’s model. The basic shortcoming of the original model is: the incapability to produce a stable path for the national income when realistic values for the different parameters (multiplier and accelerator parameters) are entered into the system of equations. Of course, this statement contradicts with the empirical evidence which supports temporary or long-lasting business cycles. In this article, we propose a generalization of the typical model incorporating delayed variables into the system of equations. The proposed modification succeeds to provide a more comprehensive explanation for the emergence of business cycles while also produce a stable trajectory for the expectation of the national income. Actually, it succeeds to model stable business cycles when realistic and stochastic values of the multiplier and accelerator parameters are entered into the system of equations. So, we can safely deduce the fact that individuals and/or institutions base their decisions (for consumption or investment levels) upon the experience of the last n years, n>1. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains three subsections: Sect. 2.1 provides a short review for the organization of the original model, Sect. 2.2 discusses the incentives of a reformulation based on delayed information structure and also providing the system of difference equations governing the whole model and Sect. 2.3 provides a practical justification for the reformulated model. Section 3 investigates the stability of some interesting special cases. Section 4 suggests a typical state feedback action for the different parameters involved and also proposes how to design the corresponding solution trajectories. Section 5 contains some numerical examples and Sect. 6 concludes the entire paper.",18
3.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,06 November 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-014-0006-z,Liberalization and FDI Performance: Evidence from ASEAN and SAFTA Member Countries,December 2014,Muhammad Shariat Ullah,Kazuo Inaba,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"South and Southeast Asian countries are integrated under two distinct regional trade blocs, namely the South Asian Association for Regional CooperationFootnote 1(SAFTA) and the Association of Southeast Asian NationsFootnote 2(ASEAN). Owing either to a perception of bolstering economic prosperity or to overcoming an economic crisis by injecting foreign capital and technology, developing and least developed participantsFootnote 3of these trade blocs’ undertook unilateral opening to international investments over recent decades. Consequently, FDI policies—i.e., national treatment, equity ceiling, sectoral opening, profit repatriation, and foreign exchange control—were gradually softened. Nonetheless, ASEAN and SAFTA members have maneuvered a wide range of fiscal incentives so as to remain more competitive and to feature attractive investment locations. Alongside the unilateral opening to FDI, these economies have signed an extensive number of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) over time.Footnote 4In addition, some countries have attempted to complement the investment liberalization process by forming bilateral trade agreements (BTAs); these are like free trade agreements (FTAs) that also contain provisions for stimulating investment at a bilateral level. In the wake of the speedy liberalization of restrictions on FDI, coupled with a rising trend in the dislocation of operations by multinational enterprises (MNEs) to access locational advantages, South and Southeast Asia emerged as key destinations for inbound FDI. The Asian Development Bank ([2007]) reported that the liberalization of investment barriers by developing countries in Asia resulted in an upward trend of FDI flow into the region in recent years. Furthermore, the FDI flows to South and Southeast Asia exceeded FDI growth in developing countries in other regions (UNCTAD [2010]). Although the developing and LDC members of ASEAN and SAFTA actively invite FDI by formulating investment-friendly policies, by offering incentives as a way to deliver higher competitiveness to the foreign firms, and by entering into a growing number of BITs, the performance in FDI attraction differs substantially among them. Hence, the critical question is what factors govern MNEs’ decisions in choosing locations for investment. Analyzing the FDI data of eight Asian countries—Hong Kong, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand—Chantasasawat et al. ([2010]) report that openness and corporate taxes are the driving forces of inward FDI in the East and Southeast Asian host countries. Their results further indicate that institutional characteristics—i.e., corruption, government stability, and rule of law—have no significant influence on FDI. Plummer and Cheong ([2009]) investigate ASEAN integration and its effects on FDI. Their findings demonstrate that BITs have insignificant positive effects on FDI inflow to the ASEAN countries. Vogiatzoglou ([2007]) unveil that the volume of bilateral trade between host and home countries, bilateral vertical production specialization links between them, international integration, degree of openness, growth rates, labor cost, and macroeconomic instability in the host country are the main determinants of FDI inflows from the selected OECD countries to the nine East Asian host countries (i.e., China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand). While some studies addressed many aspects of FDI determinants, the role of investment treaties has been inadequately explored. Therefore, the present research attempts to examine FDI effects of BITs in the nine Asian countries in which a growing momentum in signing BITs has been prevalent. Apart from that, we discern the impact of bilateral investment agreements (BTAs) on firms’ choices for investment locations. Developing and LDC member states of ASEAN and SFTA primarily attract vertical FDI, in which the investing firms tend to export the output from the host country. In this case, FDI and trade act as complements to one another. Owning to a complementary relationship between vertical investment and trade (Gast and Herrmann [2008]), BTAs are likely to constitute an integral determinant of inward FDI. In particular, BTAs between the Southern and Northern countries can stimulate FDI from the latter to the former. Furthermore, we assess the role of institutional quality in attracting inward FDI by examining law and order as well as corruption and internal conflict. Effects of these factors in the context of ASEAN and SAFTA countries have rarely been addressed in past studies. Because the sample hosts have already implemented an open-door policy toward foreign investment and they have maneuvered competitive incentive packages, institutional development might act as the driving force of future FDI inflows. Therefore, we aim to contribute by ascertaining the required institutional reforms to benefit from investment-friendly policies and incentives. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 compares FDI policies and performance of the sample countries. Section 3 presents literature on FDI determinants. Section 4 outlines the econometric model and analyzes the empirical results. Finally, Sect. 5 gives the conclusion.",3

Their motives would include a considered reduction of production costs, a strengthening of competitive advantages, and development of new markets. International relocation of production plans introduces segmentation and internationalization of the production process, in which international trade within firms or industries plays an important role. Figure 1 shows foreign direct investment, FDI, of Japan after 1989 and regional shares of her overseas production in 2007. Because the yen gradually appreciated in relation to the dollar in the latter half of the 1980s, Japanese firms started moving their plants and branches abroad to the US, Europe, and Asian countries, especially China.  Data Source: Ministry of Finance, Foreign Direct Investment of Japan, Bank of Japan, Balance of Payment, and Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Overseas Business Survey On the other hand, the Chinese economy has been continuously growing after the introduction of market mechanisms into its own economy. FDI from abroad played an important role in this expansion. Figure 2 shows the trend of FDI in China after 1989, and the shares of investing countries in 2007. Though the FDI ratio to GDP has been declining after the peak of 1994, its values are still growing. The largest investment region is Hong Kong, at 38 percent, with the investments from Asian countries being more than half, while Japan’s investment in China was about 5 percent.  Data Source: National Bureau of Statistics of China, China Statistical Yearbook The economic interdependence between Japan and China has been strengthened more and more through international trade and direct investment. The Japan–China Input–Output Tables are one of the important tools used to investigate such relations. Here we will focus on the production activities of Japanese subsidiaries in China, and investigate the role of Japanese firms in the economic relations between Japan and China, revising the Japan–China International Input–Output Table to include production activities of Japanese subsidiaries in China as distinct sectors. Global value chains or the international fragmentation of production across counties are one of the hot issues, and inter-countries input–output tables, as World Input–Output Database (Timmer et al. [2012]), OECD Inter-Country Input–Output Model (Working Party of the Trade Committee, OECD [2012]) and Asia International Input–Output Table (IDE-Jetro [2013]) are developed as tools to investigate such issues. As shown in Yang et al. ([2012]) and Koopman et al. ([2012]), the role of processing trade is important for the analysis of international trade in China.Footnote 1 However, we concentrate our attention on the interdependence between two countries, Japan and China, especially through the production activity of Japanese Subsidiaries in China. The basic idea of revising an international input–output table to include Japanese overseas activities as distinct sectors was proposed in Yamada ([2002]). In those papers, using the 1995 Japan–US International Input–Output Table of METI, we investigated the impact analysis of Japanese overseas production in the US on the Japanese economy. METI ([2005]) applied this analytical framework to their research using the 2000 Japan–US International Input–Output Table. Yamada ([2004]) produced a comparative analysis of the overseas production activities of Japanese subsidiaries in the US and Asia, using the 1995 and 2000 IDE Asia International Input–Output Tables. Teng and Fang ([2008]) applied a somewhat similar analytical framework to Japan–China relations, using 1995 and 2000 Japan–China International Input–Output Tables which were estimated by them. This paper does the same using the following two characteristics: to apply the latest economic structures of the 2007 Japan–China International Input–Output Table, and to use the microdata of the Basic Survey of Overseas Business Activities, METI, Japan.Footnote 2 The production activity of foreign affiliates in some country is highly correlated with inward FDI. FDI augments capital stock, which expand the potential capacity of production. Here repatriation of the operation surplus, induced by the production, to the investing country is expected. Some reinvestment also has to be considered. However, in this paper, we ignore the possible endogenous relation between the production and investment, mainly because of the weakness of the database to express that relation. In the next section, we discuss the theoretical framework of a revised Japan–China International Input–Output Analysis on Japanese Overseas Production. In the third section, the method used to reconstruct the input–output table for the analysis will be explained briefly. Value-added and imports, that are induced by one unit of final demand, are analyzed in Sect. 4. Some simulation analysis on the production shift of Japanese firms from Japan and China are examined in Sect. 5. Section 6 is the conclusion.",2
3.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,15 April 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-2409-3-2,Triangulation of Input–Output Tables Based on Mixed Integer Programs for Inter-temporal and Inter-regional Comparison of Production Structures,December 2014,Yasushi Kondo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The entire production structure of a national or regional economy can be represented through its input–output table (IOT), consisting of extensive numerical data on different branches of national and regional economies. Quantitative methods for summarizing and visualizing information archived in IOTs are indispensable, since understanding the industrial structure of an economy is one of the central issues in economics. Triangulation of IOTs is one such method that facilitates summarization and analysis of data. This paper proposes a new method to triangulate IOTs based on mixed integer programs (MIPs) for examining production structures of economies, and conducting inter-temporal and inter-regional comparisons. Primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in an IOT in its original form are traditionally arranged in the aforementioned order. An IOT of sufficiently detailed sector classification has many zero elements and it is a sparse matrix because most sectors require product inputs from a limited number of sectors. Therefore, an IOT may be triangulated, implying that most elements in the upper triangular part are zeros, by rearranging the sectors based on degrees of fabrication. Triangulation arrangement is fairly straightforward for sectors among which relative degrees of fabrication are clearly defined based on expert knowledge of industrial technologies. For instance, the automotive sector is followed by motor vehicle parts sectors in a triangulated table because an automobile is more highly fabricated than its parts. However, the relative degrees of fabrication among some sectors may not always be clearly defined. In all such cases, an IOT can still be triangulated approximately, for example, by solving an optimization problem. The ordering of sectors in an IOT triangulated in this manner can be interpreted as a descending order of degrees of fabrication, by analogy with the relationship between the automotive sector and motor vehicle parts sectors. This paper proposes a new method of triangulation based on optimization problems. Leontief ([1963], p. 151) traces back the history of triangulation of IOTs to the research by Marshall K. Wood, George D. Danzig, and their associates in Project Scoop of the U.S. Air Force during the late 1940s. Their original motivation in rearranging sectors was to reduce computational burden for solving a system of linear equations. However, they also found that a triangulated IOT reveals structural characteristics of the economy that it represents. Moreover, the major present day utility of triangulation is to serve as a tool for analyzing the production structure of an economy, since solving an optimization problem for triangulation is a much more computer-intensive task than solving a system of linear equations. As Korte and Oberhofer ([1970], Sect. 6) summarized, the major applications of triangulated IOTs that contribute to practical economic decision making include studying the production structure of economies, serving as a device to compare various economies, examining sectors that influence business cycles and economic growth, reducing computational burden of solving systems of linear equations, and enhancing forecasting and economic planning. In addition to the applications summarized by Korte and Oberhofer ([1970]), triangulated IOTs lend themselves to useful analysis on at least two counts in the contemporary context. First, graphical visualization of a triangulated IOT is useful in identifying inter-sectoral dependence. Triangulation greatly improves and enhances the readability of a graphically represented IOT and aids in obtaining the complete picture of inter-sectoral transactions with little loss of information for each transaction. Nakamura et al. ([2011]) provide an example of visualizing triangulated IOTs for analyzing inter-sectoral flows of iron and steel in passenger car production. The ordering of sectors in triangulated IOTs can also be used to determine the positioning of sectors in a flow diagram. Nakamura et al. ([2011]) and Nakajima et al. ([2013]) have shown such drawings through the Sankey diagrams. Second, the fundamental structure of production discussed by Simpson and Tsukui ([1965]), its inter-temporal stability, and inter-regional similarity need to be re-investigated. Following the pioneering studies by Chenery and Watanabe ([1958]), Leontief ([1963]), and Simpson and Tsukui ([1965]), a number of studies examined developed and less developed economies through triangulated IOTs and provided empirical evidence that the production structures of these economies are quite similar to each other and fairly stable over time. Korte and Oberhofer ([1970]), Lamel et al. ([1972]), Santhanam and Patil ([1972]), Song ([1977]), Fukui ([1986]), Pryor ([1994]), and Östblom ([1993, 1997]) are some such studies. With recent technological progress engendering factors such as promotion of industrial symbiosis, substitution of materials across sectors, and green product-service system, it is worth checking if these factors have caused a change in hierarchy among sectors. With this background, this paper proposes an extension of the triangulation problem for comparing the production structures of multiple economies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates a triangulation problem according to available literature and extends it for developing a new method to compare two or more IOTs. The new method is applied for inter-temporal and inter-regional comparisons in Sect. 3. Concluding remarks are outlined in Sect. 4. Computer codes used for implementing the new method are provided in the supplementary material.",7

From the perspective of resource economics, fewer reserves not only fail to meet a certain demand, but also they may make another unit of extraction more costly. Accordingly, it is necessary to expend excessive resources on explorative activities to make extraction more economic. However, explorative activities by themselves cannot keep extraction costs low because exploration itself may become more costly, based on the accumulation of the new findings. Thus, some technological breakthrough is required to resolve this situation. Many countries consider the improvement of two technologies to be important policy measures.a One is the improvement of extraction efficiency technology, which lowers the given extraction cost for the remaining reserves, and the other is the improvement of exploration efficiency technology, which increases the exploration efficiency given the cost that is already determined by that time.b Although the need to improve these two technologies is emphasized, there is little discussion regarding the difference between their effects on the resource extraction schedule. Given the circumstances surrounding scarce resources, how do we identify the appropriate technology for attaining efficient and stable resource use? In the resource economics literature, earlier studies explain the effects of resource exploration and technological change on resource extraction to bridge the gap between the real resource price path and the theoretical resource price path derived by the Hotelling rule (Hotelling [1931]). The observed real resource price does not always continue to increase according to the Hotelling rule; rather, it sometimes follows a flat path or even begins to decrease. Stewart ([1979]), Arrow and Cheng ([1982]) and Pindyck ([1978]) succeed in obtaining various non-renewable resource price paths by incorporating resource exploration into the traditional Hotelling model.c Additionally, Slade ([1982]) explains similar results due to technological changes in extraction. Theoretically, any price path could be feasible if we could choose an arbitrary speed of technological change over time. In recent studies, Lin and Wagner ([2007]) explain why the price path of many non-renewable resources empirically becomes almost constant by estimating the supply and demand function using the Slade ([1982]) framework. These earlier studies explain the effect of exploration and technological change on the use of non-renewable resources. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing study considers resource exploration and technological change in the same model while focusing on exploration technology. As previously mentioned, it is important to incorporate both resource exploration and technological change into the same model when considering the efficient use of resources with fewer reserves. This paper provides a theory for examining the efficient extraction of non-renewable resources that incorporates both resource exploration and technological change. We show how two types of technological change differently affect the efficient extraction of a non-renewable resource. In Sect. 2, we expand the economic model used by Pindyck ([1978]) by incorporating the two types of technological change. We consider a profit maximizing monopolistic producer that exploits reserves with incremental technological progress. In Sect. 3, we examine the difference between the two technologies in terms of their effects on the dynamics of the resource price, and we show that the two technologies affect the price path differently. Extraction technology decreases the marginal revenue of extraction and resource price by changing the structure of those dynamics, while exploration technology decreases the marginal revenue of extraction and the resource price by maintaining the structure of those dynamics. In Sect. 4, we present some numerical examples, and we show that the difference between the effects of the two technologies becomes significant when technology changes intermittently rather than smoothly. In Sect. 5, we present our conclusions.",1

4.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,23 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-015-0029-0,Revisiting the quality of exports,December 2015,Gerardo Fujii-Gambero,Manuel García-Ramos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In economics there is no debate that exports are important for economic growth. The currents of thought that link one concept with another are embedded in microeconomics and macroeconomics. Within the past few years, however, growing attention has been afforded to the mesoeconomic aspect of this relationship, by which we mean that the quality of exports, as determined by their composition, seen from several perspectives, is also vital for growth. The purpose of this paper is to examine quality of exports in the context of international fragmentation of production. Fragmented production gives rise to trade among countries that can be examined from two perspectives: on one hand, the imported content of a country’s exports and, on the other, part of a country’s exports can be used by importing countries to produce their own exports. Most research on this subject has focused on the quality of exports of countries that export high-technology goods and whose production is integrated in global value chains. Among the countries that participate in the global production of these goods, the international division of labor is distributed among countries that assemble the final good from imported parts and components and so their exports are very intensive in imports, while other countries specialize in the design and engineering phases of output, organizing the parts and components production’s chain, producing high-value parts, organizing the supply chain to countries that specialize in product assembly, distributing the final good worldwide, and in post-sale servicing. Exports from assembling countries are characterized by a low domestic value-added content, while exports of countries that specialize in processing and producing components (to be used by assembling countries in order to produce final goods for export) have a high value-added component. International fragmentation of the value chain does not occur exclusively in high-technology goods. It also takes place among countries that produce and export raw materials and semi-manufactured goods and importing countries that process, add value, and then export these goods. Therefore, the value of these products exported by a country that processes imported raw materials can also be differentiated by the origin of the value, i.e., between foreign value added (generated in the country of origin of the raw material), and domestic value added, which is the value added by processing the raw material that is later exported. Viewed from a raw material-exporting country, importing countries use these raw materials to produce exports or use them for other purposes. These two types of fragmentation in the value chain have been given specific names: upstream links (foreign value added embodied in exports), and downstream links (exports that are incorporated in goods produced by other countries and then re-exported) (UNCTAD 2013: 131). The purpose of this paper is to examine countries’ export quality from the double perspective mentioned before: first, how much domestic value added is embodied in exports (which is the flip side of foreign value added in exports), and, second, what use is made of a particular country’s exports in importing countries. From the first perspective, domestic value added embodied in exports acts as an indicator of export quality, given that it shows countries’ domestic-income content in their exports. The higher it is, exports will have a greater multiplier effect on domestic demand and, thus, on economic growth. Therefore, countries will be in a position to overcome the alternative they generally face between export-led growth or domestic demand-led growth. If the domestic income embodied in exports is high, the export-led growth model will kick-start domestic demand and, from the perspective of demand, growth will be doubly grounded, i.e., both foreign and domestic demand. From the second perspective, and evaluation of export’s quality depends on the role they will play in the importers’ production process—i.e. as inputs to produce exports or for other uses. If exports are raw materials or natural resource-intensive manufactures processed by other countries as exports, the share of these products in the exports of the origin country indicates the potential amount of VA that it could incorporate if it increased domestic processing of raw materials that are currently exported. If they are technology-intensive manufactures that are exported as final goods with a high imported content, export quality would be low, even if the country is exporting technologically sophisticated products, but if an important amount of this kind of exports is used by importing countries to produce exports, this may be a sign that the country is specializing in producing parts and components, or is specializing in those phases of production processes that are very intensive in generating value. This paper is structured as follows: In “Sect. 1.2”, we review the literature on the subject of export quality. In “Sect. 2”, we discuss the method for quantitative analysis of VA in countries’ exports from two perspectives: from the viewpoint of countries where VA originates, and from the perspective of how importing countries use those exports. “Sect. 3” analyses export quality focusing on domestic VA embodied in exports by country, and relates data of domestic VA in exports with their composition. At the end of “Sect. 3”, we take up export quality focusing on how exports are used by importing countries, either to produce exports or for other uses in two types of manufacturing exports: those intensive in natural resources and those intensive in technology. The paper ends with its conclusions, their possible relevance in defining policies aimed at improving export quality from the analytical perspective of this paper, and a proposal for further research suggested by our findings. Data refer to a sample of 22 economies (20 with the highest GDP plus Argentina, in 29th place, and South Africa, in 30th place, to widen the sample of countries whose primary exports make up an important part of total exports). All data come from OECD-WTO (2013), statistics on trade in value added database. Export quality is not studied in classical international trade theory. For Ricardo, it was just as advantageous to export cloth as it was to export wine. Prebisch (1949) sparked debate on the topic when he asserted that it is more advantageous to export manufactured products than primary products, since, in the long run, the terms of trade will tend to move in favor of manufactures, given their higher demand. Furthermore, prices of manufactured goods produced in countries of the economic “core” (using Prebisch’s terminology) are downwardly rigid, while prices of primary products, exported by periphery countries, are downwardly flexible, given the institutional framework of the labor market in wealthy or poor countries. Later on, using this same viewpoint, ECLAC (1995) revisited the dynamism in world demand for different types of goods, which led it to classify export products by country, according to the relationship between the dynamism of world demand for each product and the growth of exports for that particular product in a given country. ECLAC classified exports by one of four categories: rising stars, missed opportunities, retreats, and waning stars (Mandeng 1991). More recently, the problem of quality in exports has led economists to address the matter from several viewpoints. One approach emphasizes export diversification, to help overcome the instability of exports (Ghosh and Ostry 1994; Bleaney and Greenaway 2001), and increasing learning opportunities that can encourage development of comparative advantages in new products (Gutiérrez de Piñeres and Ferrantino 2000; Agosin 2009; Lederman and Maloney 2007; Hesse 2008). Another approach evaluates exports by levels of sophistication and addresses the topic by taking into account the association between the composition of exports and countries’ per-capita income levels, in the understanding that richer countries have more sophisticated exports (Lall et al. 2006; and Hausmann et al. 2007). The indicators used by the latter approach are based on product classification established by the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), a system which, in the context of an increasingly fragmented world production in certain branches of production, limits our perception of the technological level of exports based on products. Lall et al. (2006) posit two concepts that characterize exports: sophistication and technological level. While the sophistication indicator arises from the correlation between countries’ income levels and their composition of exports, the technological level, developed by Lall (2000), is defined by the intensity of R&D in products. This leads us to differentiate between high-technology exports with a low level of sophistication, and low-technology exports with a high level of sophistication. In a context of fragmented production, the first group covers technology-intensive goods that are assembled by semi-industrialized countries and then exported. Although statistics show these countries’ exports to be sophisticated, by specializing in the assembly of high-technology products for export, the fact that they participate in technologically simple phases of high technology is concealed. The second group, low-level technology but sophisticated exports of developed countries, encompasses manufactured goods based on natural resource transformation. Another focus of recent research using this same approach is derived from the concept of space-product, which estimates the possibility of diversifying the export mix in accordance to the closeness of goods within a given country’s production structure (Hausmann and Klinger 2006). There are grounds to think that, for goods within a fragmented international production structure, this concept suffers from the same limitation in evaluating export quality as the correlation between per-capita income and export composition. It is much more relevant for both approaches to establish the closeness among production processes. A different approach to understand this problem is based on calculating the unit price of exports (Rodrik 2006). To derive export quality of products from these calculations, we need to compare the unit prices of the same good exported by different countries, under the assumption that higher unit prices mean higher quality of goods. Yet, this interpretation is weakened by the fact that in import-intensive exported goods, high unit prices might be due to the high price of imported parts and components. In one of the topics explored by this paper to determine export status (by explicitly introducing the international fragmentation of output), the matter of VA in exports by country of origin has been studied particularly in countries whose exports are integrated in global value chains (GVC) to produce technology-intensive goods. Given that in this type of products the value of exports and the domestic value added integrated in them are different, two categories of countries exist: Although the value of exports may be quite high, some countries incorporate little domestic value added, given that they are involved in technologically simple phases of production of these goods; while the country that imports the final good may be re-importing value added that it itself originally generated and exported in a high-value component that is later re-imported in a finished good. Further, countries that specialize in stages that precede or follow direct production of goods are in an advantageous position, since these stages generate a good deal of value. Countries in the first category include China and Mexico, while countries in the second category include United States among others. Some of the authors who have studied this matter are Chen et al. (2005, 2008); Daudin et al. (2009); De la Cruz et al. (2011); Fujii and Cervantes (2013a, b); He and Zhang (2010); Johnson and Noguera (2011); and Koopman et al. (2008). (UNCTAD 2013, chapter 4 contains a review of research on this topic). The indicator of domestic value added embodied in exports has been used in calculating competitiveness in terms which overcome the growing limitations of an indicator based on gross exports, given the weight that foreign value added has in the export of certain goods (Timmer et al. 2013). This indicator helps us to evaluate the quality of exports, given that, as domestic value added in exports increases, so does the complexity of production processes in those countries that specialize in high-technology output in the context of internationally fragmented production; also, the degree of domestic processing of natural resource-intensive manufactures before being exported increases as well. This line of research that breaks down the value of exports by their origin and use was made possible by preparing multi-regional, input–output tables (such as UNCTAD/Eora GVC Database; OECD-WTO, Inter-Country Input–Output Model; Institute of Developing Economies (IDE-JETRO), Asian International Input–Output Tables; Purdue University, Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP); World Input–Output Database (WIOD). These new data bases have facilitated a growing number of investigations along the lines of this paper.",3

A productivity analysis of the Chinese banking sector,December 2015,Carlos Barros,Hidemichi Fujii,Shunsuke Managi,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The People’s Bank of China (PBC), now the Central Bank of China, was established in 1948 and functioned as a central bank as well as a commercial bank; in other words, it can be characterized as a monobank (García-Herrero et al., 2006). During the period from 1979 to 1984, central authorities decided to reestablish (or establish) four specialized banks (SBs), i.e., the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), the Bank of China (BOC), the China Construction Bank (CCB), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). All of the aforementioned banks were separated from the PBC (except for the CCB from the Ministry of Finance) and operated in the agricultural area, foreign exchange area, fixed-asset investment area, and industrial and commercial areas, respectively. However, they were not entirely profit oriented and had to conduct policy-related business while being hampered by government intervention. As a result, nonperforming loans arose and accumulated in the following years. When favorable market economy reforms became more widespread, the government began to take comprehensive measures to improve China’s banking system. In 1994, the government founded three policy banks to take over the policy-related business from the four SBs to transform the latter into commercial banks, which are characterized by market-functioning and profitable institutions (García-Herrero et al., 2009). Additionally, beginning in 1986, authorities approved the opening of a number of joint-equity commercial banks, including national joint-equity commercial banks and regional commercial banks, to decrease the monopoly power of the four wholly state-owned banks (WSOBs) in the financial market. The four WSOBs were castigated by the outside world for their high nonperforming loan ratios and their technical bankruptcies after the Asian financial crisis (Whalley, 2003). Therefore, the Chinese government instituted a package of measures to address the threatening situation, including issuing 270 billion Yuan, drastically reducing top-heavy employment and closing branches, reducing the tax burden, and establishing four asset management companies (AMCs) to remove a large sum of bad loans from the four WSOBs (Bonin and Huang, 2001). When China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, there were new challenges brought to the financial sector before they would fully open up to the world 5 years later. Considering the loss of market shares and even bankruptcy, the government favored enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of domestic commercial banks, particularly the four state-owned banks (SOBs). It launched a series of reforms to improve the banking industry so that it could compete with foreign counterparts. First, a special banking supervisory organization—the Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC)—was established in 2003. Second, the government utilized the exchange rate reserve to replenish the capital funds of Chinese commercial banks through a sovereign wealth fund company, i.e., the Central Huijin Company. Third, the government transformed the four SOBs into joint-stock commercial banks and listed them on the stock exchange so that they would be supervised by market forces. Table 1 shows the 14 key commercial banks in China.",3

Several techniques are able to assess the importance of technical change or productivity change considering environmental or resource performance. Deterministic frontier analysis of data envelopment analysis, or stochastic frontier analysis, in addition to the conventional production function approach is useful tools in this objective (Barros et al. 2013; Managi et al. 2004; Kumar et al. 2015).

Alatriste-Contreras,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The structure of the interdependencies between sectors determines the aggregate and sectoral impact of sectoral shocks and stimulus. Nevertheless, economic analysis has mainly focused on the aggregate impact without exploring how the effect is asymmetrically distributed among sectors. The aim of the paper is to study the properties of the productive structure of national economies and a region and to identify how this structure determines the different roles and importance of sectors in the economy. We focus on identifying the key sectors that bring the largest impacts on sectoral and aggregate production. The structure of the economy is defined as the components of the macroeconomic aggregates and the patterns of interactions between them (Thakur 2011). These components are aggregated into economic activities or sectors and are connected through intersectoral linkages. Input–output analysis provides analytical tools to study the intersectoral dependencies and their aggregate impact. Examples of such tools include backward and forward linkages, multipliers, and structural decomposition (McGilvray 1977; Miller and Blair 2009). Linkage measures are used to identify key sectors in the economy as those that generate above average linkages (Rasmussen 1956). In a development strategy, it is recommendable to stimulate a key sector because it will impact positively on growth (Chenery and Watanabe 1958; Hirschman 1958). After the first introduction of the linkage measures, several changes have been proposed (Jones 1975). Examples of alternative methods to compute linkages include the eigenvector method (Dietzenbacher 1992), the hypothetical extraction method (Dietzenbacher and van der Linden 1997), and complementary measures that capture factors beyond the production system such as environmental or resource factors (Temurshoev and Oosterhaven 2010). Dietzenbacher and Romero
(2007) proposed the mean of average propagation lengths that measures the average number of steps it takes for a shock on final demand of sector i to reach sector j and show that the average distance between these two sectors does not depend on whether the backward or forward perspective is adopted. Finally, Humavindu and Stage (2013) introduced the idea of identifying key sectors in the economy not only based on their backward and forward linkages but on the dispersion of those measures to capture how the effects are not evenly distributed. Comparably, the present paper investigates the properties of the structure of the economy and proposes an alternative method to identify key sectors taking into account the diffusion of effects based on the Herfindahl concentration Index and centralities of sectors. In comparison to the input–output literature on the fundamental structure, the analysis in this paper considers all connections between sectors and does not impose a threshold above which the interaction is taken into account and analyzes all channels of the diffusion of a sectoral shock to evaluate the importance of a sector in the economy. Our analysis is part of an interdisciplinary approach where complex network analysis uses input–output data to study the productive structure of an economy as a network. Literature on this approach has mainly focused on the computation of network measures like centrality of sectors to study the structural properties of the economic system and identify key sectors that play a central role (Blöchl et al. 2011; Garcia-Muniz et al. 2008; McNerney et al. 2012; Reyes 2002; Slater 1978; Xu et al. 2011). Some of the centrality measures applied in network analysis have their equivalent in linkage measures found in input–output literature such as direct linkages and strength measures. Therefore, this paper focuses on exploring centrality measures associated to other structural properties of the economic system like the diffusion of shocks. We represent the economy as a network, where sectors are nodes and the relationships of supply and demand of inputs are the links connecting them together. This network is a weighted directed graph with self loops.Footnote 1 Self loops capture the idea of sectors using their own output as inputs in the production process. The paper analyzes the European Union’s (EU) economy as one system and the economy of each country member. Input–output data was obtained from the Eurostat data base for the year 2005 for 22 countries and the EU economy. The method consists on computing input-output linkages and authority and hub centralities of sectors in the network and comparing the most central sectors to the sectors that bring about a high aggregate effect on production when they receive a shock on final demand, while having a good diffusion of the effect across the economy. Results show that the sectors with the highest centralities are the ones that have the best diffusion properties and a high impact on aggregate production. These results have important implications for economic policy design because authority and hub scores identify key sectors in the economy suited for selective promotion when the government is aiming at a high aggregate impact and a wide diffusion of the effect across sectors. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers data and methods, where we detailed the database and define the measures we applied. Section 3 presents the results for the European Union and each country member. Section 4 makes a discussion about the results and its implications for the European economy and concludes. Input–output data provides a natural source of information for representing the economy as a network. This type of data describes the intersectoral dependencies in an economy. However, input–output tables offer as many representations of the economy as sector classifications there are. Nevertheless, having available input–output tables for several countries and regions under one homologous classification represents an advantage to study productive structures together. Therefore, we use input–output data for the European Union under one unique sector classification. Eurostat provides symmetric input–output tables for the EU as a whole and for each European country in the EU. Footnote 2 These tables give information on the intersectoral transactions in million Euros and use the NACE Rev. 1 classification on a second level consisting of divisions.Footnote 3 The input-output tables are disaggregated into 59 sectors or economic activities (see Table 1). The most recent year when the EU and most of the countries have an intermediate demand table useful for the analysis is 2005. We left out Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, and Malta that did not have data for that year, leaving the following 22 countries for the analysis: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Therefore, we have 23 input–output tables, one for each of the 22 European countries and one for the EU as a whole.

An application of a super slacks-based measure of efficiency,December 2015,Satoshi Honma,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The impact of trade liberalization on the environment has attracted considerable attention from policy makers and academic researchers. Grossman and Krueger (1993) emphasize the role of international trade on the environment and decompose the effects of trade openness into three separate mechanisms as follows: scale, technique, and composition effects. The scale effect refers to an increase in pollution emissions resulting from economic expansion by trade openness. The technique effect refers to a reduction in pollution emissions due to the demand for stricter environmental regulations with rising income. The composition effect refers to a change in the industrial structure through trade openness. In particular, the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), which asserts that dirtier industries move from developed countries to developing countries, remains controversial. The seminal paper of Antweiler et al. (2001) regresses pollution concentration on representative variables of the above three effects. Their empirical results show a positive scale effect, a negative technique effect, and a negative composition effect. However, the composition effect caused by trade varies across countries depending on relative income and factor abundance (see also Cole and Elliott 2003; Frankel and Rose, 2005; and Managi et al. 2009). In the abovementioned previous studies, per capita pollution emission is regressed on variables representing scale, technique, and composition effects. Because emission and income are a consequence of the production process, an empirical strategy to regress pollution emissions on income and trade openness fails to understand the underlying production process (Zaim and Taskin, 2000)Footnote 1. Therefore, we take environmental efficiency as a dependent variable. As long as pollutants are not freely disposable (weak disposability), reducing pollutants involves a transformation of the production process, which requires sacrificing the output and additional inputs. Taking environmental efficiency as a dependent variable allows us to measure an alternative measure of environmental degradation instead of pollution emissions per capita. This study aims to investigate whether international trade is beneficial to the environment, using environmental efficiency. Therefore, we use a super environmental efficiency index that modifies Li et al. (2013) model and apply it to 98 countries, including developed and developing countries, for 1970–2008 and for the following four pollutants: SO2, NOx, particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter (PM10), and CO2. To examine the impacts of trade on environmental efficiency, we regress the efficiency values on trade openness and other variables. Because the scores in the traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models censored at unity, when one uses the obtained scores as a dependent variable in the regression one should resort to Tobit estimation. However, the Tobit estimation applied in fixed effects in the panel data involves complications and cannot consistently estimate fixed effects. Because the super-efficiency model assigns an efficiency score larger than unity to the efficient units, the obtained scores are tractable in the second-stage analysis. This study is the first one to apply the super slacks-based measure (SBM) efficiency measurement for the world dataset in environmental economics. Traditionally, environmental performance involving desirable and undesirable outputs has been analyzed by the directional distance function approach (Färe et al. 1993; Chung et al. 1997; Picazo-Tadeo et al. 2005). However, it cannot directly treat input excesses and output shortages, which are termed “slacks.” Tone (2001) proposes the SBM model, which is a non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. In measuring environmental performance, non-radial efficiency measurement in the SBM model exerts more discriminating power than the radial one in traditional DEA models (Zhou et al. 2006; Wei et al. 2012). Namely, some of the efficient decision making units (DMUs) in traditional models become inefficient in the SBM model. Furthermore, the super SBM efficiency model proposed by Tone (2002) has a higher level of discriminating power than the SBM model because it can rank the efficient DMUs, allowing above-unity scores. Recently, SBM efficiency is applied to environment and energy studies; for example, OECD countries (Zhou et al. 2006), China (Choi et al. 2012; Li and Hu, 2012; Chang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013). Li et al. (2013), construct a super SBM efficiency measurement with undesirable outputs and apply it to China’s regional environmental efficiency. However, its definition (Eq. 3 in their paper) seems to be inadequate. We give the right definition. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the paper’s methodology and data. Section 3 presents the efficiency results. Section 4 investigates the determinants of environmental efficiency in the panel regression. Section 5 concludes the study with a brief summary.",7
4.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,13 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-015-0020-9,Quality-adjusted productivity gain in the propagation of innovation,December 2015,Satoshi Nakano,Kazuhiko Nishimura,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Research and development (R&D) is considered the central driving force of national competitive advantage. Effectively using limited R&D resources is an important agenda when promoting and evaluating national level R&D programs Lee et al. (2009). In some cases, a large portion of national R&D resources are distributed to target technologies under the “selective focus and contraction strategy” Lee and Song (2007). However, we believe that this policy could impede the harmonious and sound development of the economy, because of mutual interdependencies in current and potential industrial production technologies. With this in mind, we are interested in investigating what allocations of public R&D investment could promote effective innovations and gain more welfare. Contrary to R&D investment, innovation (the consequence of R&D) has been postulated as an intermediate stage of gaining welfare, rather than a measurement in terms of monetary value. Innovation is commonly defined as the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, marketing method, or organizational method in business practices, workplace organization, or external relations OECD/Eurostat (2005). Most work on innovation (as reviewed in Hall (2011)) has used surveys based on a version of this definition, typically using dummy variables that represent a product and/or process innovation (e.g., Griffith et al. (2006)), innovative sales shares (e.g., van Leeuwen and Klomp (2006)), or patent counts (e.g., Crépon et al. (1998)) as proxies to explain the growth of productivity. Productivity growth fills the gap between growths in the quantitative inputs and outputs of production. Hence, a productivity growth signifies welfare increase that can be attributed to innovation. In other words, the productivity growth (or gain) can be used to evaluate the economic significance of an innovation that occurred within some interval of time. Additionally, because R&D is considered to inflate productivity, many researchers have investigated the connection between R&D investment (including R&D capital stock) and productivity growth (among others Griliches (1994), Hall and Mairesse (1995), Sakurai et al. (1997), Kuroda and Nomura (2004), Parisi et al. (2006), Coccia (2009), and Hall et al. (2009)). This study also takes the position that R&D’s direct achievement is the gain in productivity. We are interested in the consequential influence of R&D investment, rather than the mechanism behind R&D’s promotion of innovation. Therefore, we directly use productivity gain as a measure of innovation, and then relate R&D investments with that measure. 
Footnote 1 
More importantly, in contrast to previous research, we are concerned with the economy-wide propagation of innovation. Productivity gain reduces the marginal cost of production, and the corresponding price change influences the selection of technologies (substitution of inputs) for other industries, because of technological interdependencies between industrial sectors. A system of unit cost functions (which are compatible with constant returns to scale) can be used to model the economy-wide technological structural equilibrium and the propagation triggered by any exogenous productivity gain. At the same time, we are also concerned with qualitative changes in the inputs and outputs of production. In this regard, we take the efficiency unit approach Hulten (1992), which incorporates quality in terms of quantity. The underlying idea of the efficiency unit approach is to consider everything in terms of efficiency units (effective quantities), using the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) for the target compared with the standard-quality commodity. Because economic efficiency equalizes MRS and price ratios, the qualities (the MRS with respect to the standard) and prices used to differentiate the quality of (perfect substitute) commodities become proportional Gordon (1990) under the static equilibrium for a certain technology state (see Fig. 1). However, innovation breaks this proportionality. Accordingly, we use this proportional disparity to measure innovation.
 Proportionality shift We can measure proportionality shifts using hedonic regression, where the set of observed prices are regressed against the Lancasterian attributes Lancaster (1966) of goods. This is a commonly used approach for estimating quality-adjusted consumer price indices (CPI). 
Footnote 2
Proportionality shifts can be measured via the price change (in the form of a deflator) of a quality-standardized commodity. Because such a deflator includes qualitative and quantitative improvements, we call it a quality-adjusted deflator. Monetary accounts of different periods are typically realized using deflators that only consider the price change. The quality-adjusted deflator considers the price and quality changes. 
Footnote 3
 For simplicity, we assume that any production is subject to constant returns to scale in effective quantities, whereas any assessment of quality (MRS) is universal, meaning that the same quality-adjusted deflators are applicable to any production or consumer. Then, the combined qualitative and quantitative innovation exclusively within an industry can be measured by applying quality-adjusted deflators to both inputs and outputs of production. We call this local innovation measure the quality-adjusted productivity gain of an industry. 
Footnote 4
Naturally, we relate industry-wise R&D investments with industry-wise quality-adjusted productivity gains. We use quality-adjusted unit cost functions (which map the costs of effective unit outputs) to evaluate the propagative effects of industry-wise R&D investments with respect to the gain in social welfare. In Section 2, we introduce the concept of quality-adjusted productivity, which reflects the innovation that is exclusive to an industry (i.e., local innovation). This is closely related to the industry-wise R&D. In Section 3, we introduce the concept of structural propagation, which is initiated by the introduction of innovation involving qualitative and quantitative improvements, and connect the ex-post equilibrium state with social welfare. In addition, R&D investment allocation optimization is demonstrated via a small prototype model. Section 4 contains our concluding remarks.",

The prefectures’ IOTs have been effectively used for the evaluation of many events, the policy evaluation of local governments, and the economic planning of the regions. Recently, the prefectures’ tables have been applied to compile them into a multi-regional IOT (hereafter MRIOT). This tendency stems from the recognition that the multi-regional input-output analysis becomes more important, because the regional economies are strongly connected domestically and internationally. It is well known that there are two types in the MRIOT, Isard-type and Chenery-Moses-type (Miller and Blair (2009)). They differ in the assumption of interregional trade coefficient. The former require a complete set of intra- and interregional data, though it is difficult to obtain such interregional trade coefficients for each sector in each region, especially within a country. On the other hand, the latter has advantages in compiling the table, because of the simplification in applying the common interregional trade coefficient for each sector in each region. For this reason, MRIOTs within a country usually have been compiled as Chenery-Moses type. Nevertheless, the interregional trade data within a country are still difficult to obtain fully, which forces one to shift from adopting the survey method to some kind of non-survey method in the estimation of the interregional trade coefficients. LQ techniques, gravity model, RAS method, and others have been developed or applied for such estimation. Lahr (1993) reviewed typical regional input-output models from 1963 to 1992 and pointed out the importance of the hybrid approach, both survey-based and non-survey, to construct an accurate input-output table with reasonable costs. Cross-hauling (the simultaneous exporting and importing of one and the same type of product) is important in interregional trade, because ignoring it induces the underestimation of trade and overestimation of regional output multiplier (see Kronenberg (2009)). LQ techniques are easy to manipulate at least for two regions, though the techniques have the disadvantage that the cross-hauling is inevitably eliminated in the interregional trade. The gravity model, which originally stems from the theory in Physics, is applied to explain the commodity flows among regions, allowing cross-hauling in the interregional trade. The RAS method is originally developed for the estimation of the input output coefficients, for which only the peripheral information of the column-sums and the row-sums is known, in the iterative way. This method requires initial values, on which the solution depends. Sargento et al. (2012) compared and assessed the performance of some gravity models for explaining the interregional trade among regions. Nakano and Nishimura (2013) estimated one type of gravity model with cross-hauling using a survey on interregional transactions and constructed three-regional IOTs of Japan. In this paper, using the IOTs for the three prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Mie, respectively, we recompile them into one type of MRIOT for the Tokai Region covering those prefectures. For this purpose, we first break down each prefecture’s table into the tables for several small areas. Then the commodity flows among the areas for each sector are estimated by the Gravity-RAS method, in which the initial values for RAS iterative calculation are reduced from the estimated Gravity model. Finally, we integrate all the small area tables into a MRIOT, using the estimated transaction shares of the commodity flows. This MRIOT for the Tokai Region consists of 186 sectors for each of the 14 areas. Breaking down the prefecture IOTs into those of several small areas and the integration of the small area IOTs into one MRIOT may make it possible to solve the analytical problem that a region identified in terms of economic activity is not necessarily the same as the administrative region. Nagoya is the third largest metropolitan area in Japan, following Tokyo and Osaka. Nagoya City, the capital city of Aichi Prefecture, is the economic center of the Tokai Region. However, each surrounding area is not equally connected to Nagoya City. Generally speaking, the closer the distance between areas, the stronger their economic connection. Thus, using the MRIOT for the Tokai Region, we investigate such relations by the Average Propagation Lengths (APL) index proposed by Dietzenbacher et al. (2005). In Section 2, the related preceding studies in Japan are briefly discussed. Then in Section 3, we introduce a method to recompile our MRIOT of the Tokai Region. Section 4 discusses the structural characteristics of the Tokai Region, and in Section 5, the characteristics of the Nagoya metropolitan area are examined in terms of the APL index. Finally, Section 6 provides concluding remarks.",14

Tzeremes,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Disaster mitigation and adaptation are important for sustainable economy in a society. Macroeconomists and environmental economists have been studying on the economic analysis of disasters. The economic impact from disasters and the mechanism alleviating from disasters (such as insurance) has been well studied in the literature (see, e.g., Cavallo et al. 2013; McDermott et al. 2014). There are cases indicating that more disasters are associated with more GDP (Cavallo et al. 2013; Managi & Sharma 2015). As has been pointed out by McDermott et al. (2014), mild shocks can stimulate reconstruction and therefore can cause growth. However, there is a broader view in the literature that humanitarian and climatic disasters have a direct negative effect on economic output (Raddatz 2007). Often after a disaster event, an immediate request of an investment could be misused. This is because recovery from disasters requires immediate decision making which can result on less efficient use of investment to the economy. On the other hand, unused capital or old infrastructure could be replaced by new investment. This implies that there is a better chance of economic capitalization improvement, giving opportunities to new industries, by replacing old infrastructure. In this case, we expect that countries’ production efficiency will improve after the disaster. Furthermore, it might be that the improvement in productivity is possible when disaster events are relatively small as recovery process is easily managed. In contrast when the disaster occurrences increase significantly, then there might be much less time for efficient decision making and as a consequence productivity decreases. If that is the case, an inverted “U” shape relationship between productivity and disaster occurrences can be observed. However, another possibility is that productivity can be increased by a creative reconstruction when there are significant damages to the economy after an increased number of disaster occurrences. In addition, there is the possibility that for a small number of disaster occurrences (as well as for small disaster impacts), productivity might decrease since it is expected that there will be no change in industrial composition. In this case, a “U” shape relationship between productivity and disaster occurrences could be seen from the data. This paper aims to provide empirical evidence examining such relationships in a global level. This is the first study which presents empirically the underline mechanism of how disaster is related to countries’ productive efficiency and consequent productivity change using global data. Specifically, our study contributes to the existing literature by investigating for the first time the effect of man-made and natural disaster occurrences on countries’ production efficiency levels. Specifically, we apply time-dependent conditional efficiency measures in a nonparametric framework (Mastromarco & Simar 2014). Then we utilize a newly developed approach introduced by Bădin et al. (2012) to a sample of 137 countries over the period of 1980–2011. In that respect, our paper examines in a dynamic framework the effect of disaster events on countries’ technological change (swift of the frontier) and on countries’ technological catch-up (distribution of efficiencies). Finally, our nonparametric framework does not assume any specific functional relationship of countries’ production process and therefore provides us with the ability to reveal any nonlinear relationships which may exist. The structure of our paper is as follows. Section 2 describes data and methodology while Section 3 presents the results. Finally, the last section concludes the paper.",12

Against this background and given that the nation’s recent power market reforms increasingly focus on such users, understanding the demand for electricity in the two sectors is crucial from a regulatory policy viewpoint. In particular, determining the extent to which the demand for electricity in Japan fluctuates in response to a rate hike by each supplier company is a key political concern for energy policy makers. Moreover, changes in the composition of electric power generation, following the suspension of nuclear power plants and the introduction of renewable energy sources, are likely to increase electricity rates in the future. Therefore, determining the effects of fluctuating electricity rates on electricity demand in each region is critical for energy policy formulation in Japan. That electricity demand is inelastic is conventional wisdom, and thus, related research has often hypothesized that the price elasticity of electricity demand is significantly low (e.g., −0.1 or almost 0). For instance, Kanemoto et al. (2006) and Tanaka (2007) conducted simulations using a general equilibrium model for electricity market deregulations and hypothesized a price elasticity of −0.1 for electricity demand, drawing on their assertion that the absolute value of elasticity is extremely low in Japan. Although such a hypothesis may be rational in the national aggregated market for electricity, it may not be appropriate when analyzing electricity demand using sectoral data. This is because the reactions of economic entities to changing rates may significantly differ across, for example, the industrial and commercial sectors. In Japan, especially, existing empirical studies have largely adopted aggregated data and neglected sectoral differences in electricity demand. Thus, to empirically validate the price elasticity of electricity demand, a re-evaluation of price elasticity using sectoral data is needed. To the best of our knowledge, limited research analyzes Japan’s sectoral data from this perspective. For example, Hosoe and Akiyama (2009) conducted an empirical analysis of electric power demand; however, they do not distinguish electricity demand between the industrial and commercial sector. In Japan, since the deregulation of retail electric power in March 2000, electricity demand by customers with electric contracts larger than a specified amount has been classified as “special-scale demand.” However, the 10 electric power companies in Japan disclose only large-scale industrial and commercial demand data. Therefore, an economic analysis of electricity demand using stable regional time-series data requires the classification of electricity sales volume into two categories: residential sector and non-residential sector. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) recently released a statistics report, Energy Consumption Statistics by Prefecture, which provides time-series data by energy sector for each prefecture. The statistics clearly distinguish between industrial and commercial electricity demand, thus making it possible to conduct a sector-based demand analysis; however, it only reports data on total electricity demand by prefecture. The total electricity demand, nevertheless, includes not only sales volume but also the power generated and consumed by privately owned power facilities.Footnote 1 Therefore, we focus on the trend of total electricity demand as a whole and not electricity sales volume in particular. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use sectoral data from the Energy Consumption Statistics by Prefecture to measure the price elasticity of industrial and commercial electricity demand and analyze factors that increase electricity demand. We first estimate the industrial and commercial electricity demand function to shed light on how a rate change affects overall demand. Second, to assess the price elasticity of electricity demand and fill the gaps in the extant literature, we adopt the dynamic panel estimation method, which also allows us to tackle the problem of an endogenous electric demand function. Third, we conduct a structural analysis of demand across Japan’s regions, in particular electricity company jurisdictions. By identifying the factors influencing changes in electricity demand, we estimate the impact of a rate hike on such changes. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature. Section 3 discusses the methodology and data. Section 4 estimates the electricity demand function and presents a structural analysis. Section 5 presents the conclusions and discusses the potential for future research.",10

4.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,10 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-015-0017-4,Measuring the comprehensive wage effect of changes in unit labor cost,December 2015,Hideyuki Mizobuchi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Unit labor cost (ULC) is defined as labor compensation per unit of value added.Footnote 1 As it captures labor cost required to produce one unit of value added, it is widely accepted as an appropriate measure of cost competitiveness for a producer.Footnote 2 ULC is often computed for industries and countries. Monitoring it over a period or across units helps one to track their cost competitiveness. While labor compensation is units of labor multiplied by labor compensation per unit of labor (simply wage), the value added divided by units of labor defines labor productivity.Footnote 3 Thus, ULC can be considered the ratio of wage to labor productivity. A change in the ULC is often attributed to a change in the wage (wage effect) and in labor productivity (labor productivity effect). This suggests that there are two ways of enhancing cost competitiveness: retaining wage or raising labor productivity. This conventional decomposition of the change or difference in ULC into two effects has been applied to investigate the sources of cost competitiveness for industries or countries.Footnote 4 Van Ark et al. (2005) compare the ULC of the manufacturing sector for OECD member countries. They indicated that even among advanced economies, there are significant differences between countries in terms of the relative contributions of the wage and labor productivity effects.Footnote 5

Footnote 6
 However, the current decomposition of the changes in ULC has shortcomings. These arise from the fact that wage and labor productivity are not independently determined. Faced with input prices such as user cost of capital and wage, a firm’s demand for capital and labor is such that production cost is minimized. Thus, a rise in wage induces a firm to employ more capital and hire less labor. As Mizobuchi (2014) emphasizes, this is likely to raise labor productivity, holding other factors constant. Thus, the labor productivity effect in a conventional decomposition is partly attributable to wage changes. In other words, this indirect impact of a wage change through labor productivity is not captured by the current measure of the wage effect. This study proposes an alternative decomposition of changes in the ULC into three components; these are two factor-price effects (user cost of capital and wage) and a technical change effect. First, we define each component theoretically using a ULC function. Second, we derive index number formulae that approximate each component. The wage effect in this decomposition captures fully the impact of a change in wages on the ULC. Its direct impact on labor compensation as well as its indirect impact through a change in labor productivity is captured. We show that the bias in the conventional measure of wage effect depends on production technology, especially output elasticity or factor shares. We apply our decomposition to data from 18 OECD countries by employing EU KLEMS. We focus on the period 1995–2006, for which data is available for the largest number of countries. For each country, we decompose the ULC of the whole country, manufacturing sector, and electricity, gas, and water supply sector. This allows us to quantify empirically by how much the conventional measure of wage effect overestimates or underestimates the comprehensive impact on ULC of wage changes. Since the underlying technology varies across sectors, the magnitude of bias in the conventional wage effect is also likely to vary. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 decomposes the change in ULC into three components. Section 3 applies this decomposition to data from OECD countries. Section 4 concludes the paper.",
4.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,27 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-015-0018-3,Baseline analysis of productivity changes with and without considering carbon dioxide emissions in the major manufacturing sector of Indonesia,December 2015,Erik Armundito,Shinji Kaneko,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The abundance of fossil energy resources as well as a large population has been the foundation of development in Indonesia. However, since 2004, Indonesia has become a net oil-importing country if we consider the trade balance of both crude oil and petroleum commodities. In addition, as of 2013, Indonesia ranked as the 11th largest CO2-emitting country after Canada [1]. As a growing and developing country in Asia with a relatively large but young demographic structure, Indonesia will not only confront domestic policy challenges but will also begin to draw international attention after China and India in seeking a future development pathway that is less fossil energy resource dependent and that creates more job opportunities. Although these challenges should be addressed by various sectors as declared by Indonesia’s master plan of 2011, the manufacturing sector is one of the most important sectors due to its large potential for creating job opportunities. At the same time, there is concern regarding the increasing demand for energy generated by the economic development policy through further industrialization and development of the manufacturing sector. Currently, total final energy consumption (TFEC) in the manufacturing sector represents 27.4 % of the TFEC of Indonesia in 2011, and this share has been growing steadily over the last two decades [2]. As the international oil price has increased since 2000 and has remained high compared to prices in the 1990s, the government of Indonesia as a net oil-importing country started to gradually remove subsidies for energy commodities starting in 2005. Consequently, the domestic price of oil commodities in Indonesia has been rising since this time, which has caused a significant financial burden for the manufacturing industry. Although economic instruments implemented within climate change mitigation policies such as a carbon tax have not yet been implemented in Indonesia, the recent rising price of domestic oil commodities can be seen as a quasi-carbon tax instrument because it has similar consequences. With these as background and motivation, this paper reports empirical evidence of changes in the total factor productivity (TFP) of manufacturing firms in Indonesia over time from 1990 to 2010 with and without considering CO2 emissions. The comparison of the TFP with and without considering CO2 emissions across different sectors of the manufacturing industry enables us to identify firm reactions to changes in the prices of oil commodities. It should be noted that although historical data for manufacturing firms in Indonesia are available from the datasets of annual manufacturing surveys conducted by the Indonesian Statistics Agency (BPS) for medium- and large-sized firms that employ at least 20 workers, the datasets contain inaccurate, incomplete, and erroneous data. Therefore, despite the availability of large sets of data, to the best of our knowledge, empirical studies of Indonesian manufacturing firms are limited. To overcome this constraint, we first developed a cleaned panel dataset from the annual survey data of medium- and large-sized firms in the manufacturing sector of Indonesia between 1990 and 2010, which is used for the present analysis. Because the system of firm identity codes was changed between 2000 and 2001, it is impossible to construct continuous annual firm datasets between two periods, namely 1990–2000 and 2001–2010. In addition, we found that some of key variables such as capital stock and energy consumption, which are necessary for the present analysis, are completely missing in the survey data for 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2007. Therefore, the cleaned and balanced panel datasets are constructed for only four periods: 1990–1995, 1998–2000, 2003–2006, and 2008–2010. For these periods, the paper provides empirical results from the baseline analysis for productivity measurements. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. provides a brief description of the contextual background of the analysis and a literature review. Section 2 explains the methodological approach. Section 3 presents the empirical results and a discussion, followed by concluding remarks in Section 4. The state-led industrial policy strategy began in the 1970s in Indonesia during the Suharto regime, driven by a large windfall in government oil revenue from 1973 to 1980 through the development of state-owned firms. The government strictly protected the state-owned firms and other domestic producers from international competition by providing tariff and non-tariff barriers, raw material subsidies, and credit subsidies in addition to maintaining undervalued exchange rates [3, 4]. Whereas the share of the manufacturing sector to GDP increased, empirical studies generally agreed that there was no gain and potentially negative TFP growth in the manufacturing sector in Indonesia during the period between 1975 and 1985 [5–7]. In 1986, the devaluation of the exchange rate of the rupiah against the US dollar triggered a shift in foreign direct investment (FDI) from the Asian newly industrialized economies to Indonesia, which promoted a labor-intensive manufacturing base in industries such as textiles, shoes, wood products, and processed food. As a result of an increasingly open economic policy, the share of manufacturing products has significantly expanded in terms of foreign exports since the middle of the 1980s. Furthermore, with the development of the machinery industry driven by FDI, the export of machinery products has also increased since the late 1980s and early 1990s. The shift to an FDI-led import substitution policy of industrialization has resulted in an increase in TFP for the manufacturing sector of Indonesia. Table 1 summarizes the results of the selected literature measuring the TFP growth of the Indonesian manufacturing sector using firm-level data for the period between 1970 and 2000. Although specific periods and numbers are not exactly the same and comparable, general shifts in TFP growth before and after the middle of the 1980s are commonly and consistently reported. Moreover, TFP growth seems to have continued until 1997, at which point the Asian economic crisis hit the Indonesian economy. Suharto’s relinquishing presidential office in 1998 evidences the seriousness of the adverse effects from the Asian financial crisis on the Indonesian economy, and this crisis also caused significant turbulence and confusion in measurements of TFP growth. As mentioned earlier, the datasets used in our analysis have several breaks, and the period before and after the Asian financial crisis is one of these breaks. Table 2 provides a summary of the key variables in the four analyzed periods to describe the contextual background of the present analysis. Period 1 from 1990 to 1995, which is the longest among the four analyzed periods in the paper, exhibited the highest average GDP growth rate at 7.9 %, and the growth rate of the manufacturing sector during this period was also the highest. Consequently, the share of the manufacturing sector to GDP increased from 21.6 to 24.5 %, and the share in total merchandise exports also increased from 35.5 to 50.6 %. Furthermore, the share of high-technology exports to manufactured exports expanded substantially from 1.6 to 7.3 %. In contrast, the growth rate of total final energy consumption (TFEC) for Indonesia and the growth rate of the manufacturing sector grew less quickly than that for production, resulting in an elasticity of TFEC to GDP of 0.57 and 0.75, respectively. Although net crude oil exports and the share of fuel exports to merchandise exports have been declining during the period, trade surpluses of more than 30 million TOE of crude oil were maintained. Overall, the last phase of the Suharto regime can be summarized as a time when the productivity and energy efficiency of the manufacturing sector was improved through an export-led industrialization policy. Period 2 from 1998 to 2000 is characterized as an immediate post-economic crisis period and marks the beginning of democratic reforms after the Suharto regime. Per capita GDP in constant US dollars at 2005 prices moved to an even lower range compared to 1995, and the average GDP growth rate was only 2.8 % during the period. However, the manufacturing sector performed relatively better despite the negative effects of the financial crisis. The share of the manufacturing sector to GDP slightly expanded from 26.0 to 27.1 % and that of exports to merchandise increased from 45.0 to 57.1 %. At the same time, the share of high-technology exports to manufactured exports also continued to increase from 10.4 to 16.4 %. However, energy consumption in Indonesia sharply increased during this time, and the elasticity of TFEC to GDP was 2.07, whereas the elasticity of the manufacturing sector was 1.25. Net crude oil exports started to decline from 27.3 to 17.4 million TOE, and the net export of oil products turned negative during this period. Period 3 between 2003 and 2006 covers a politically significant transitional moment when President Yudoyono became the first president of the country elected by a direct presidential election in 2004. Immediately after electing a new president, the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and tsunami hit the country. The period first experienced a transition from positive to negative net oil exports considering both crude oil and oil commodities. Coincidentally, unprecedented and continuously soaring international oil prices finally forced the government of Indonesia to begin removing subsidies for oil commodities twice in 1 year in March and October 2005, doubling the prices for most oil commodities in the domestic market. Under these conditions, the manufacturing sector grew annually by 5.2 % on average, which was slightly lower than GDP growth. Meanwhile, the share of manufactured exports to merchandise exports dropped from 52.1 to 44.7 %, and the share of high-technology exports to manufactured exports also shrank from 14.8 to 13.5 %. The energy intensity of the country as measured by the ratio of TFEC to GDP greatly improved, while the energy intensity of the manufacturing sector worsened. It is expected that manufacturing firms faced a significant increase in energy costs. Period 4 from 2008 to 2010 was in the middle of the 10-year presidency of Yudoyono and of the global financial crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The adverse shock caused in Indonesia by the global financial crisis was relatively small, and the average GDP growth rate in period 4 was maintained, staying as high as that of period 3. However, the growth rate of the manufacturing sector slowed and the shares of the manufacturing sector to GDP, manufactured products to merchandise exports, and high-technology products to manufactured products all shrank. At the same time, dependency on imported oil commodities increased remarkably, whereas the average growth rate of TFEC in the manufacturing sector was 6.4 %, which is much higher than production growth, resulting in an elasticity of 1.85. Amid such circumstances, the overall energy intensity of manufacturing firms did not improve. Further subsidy removal was implemented in 2008, and it is likely that the additional burden put a strain on manufacturing firms. A number of studies have attempted to analyze changes in productivity addressing multiple outputs, including both desirable and undesirable outputs. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is one approach commonly employed to measure productive efficiency and is known as a non-parametric frontier approach [8]. DEA develops a non-parametric envelopment frontier encompassing all sample data as observed points lying on or below the frontier. The points on the production frontier are considered to be efficient decision-making units (DMUs), and the points below the production frontier are regarded as inefficient DMUs. The efficiency of each observation is measured by calculating the distance between the observed level of production and the production frontier as solutions of a linear programming problem. However, the DEA method does not evaluate the shift in the frontier over time; instead DEA only estimates the performance of DMUs in reference to the best practice frontier in a given year. The Malmquist productivity index is then introduced by adjusting the DEA application for multiyear observations alternately between t and t + 1 to account for a shift in the frontier and to allow the measurement of changes in productive efficiency over time. The index measuring change in productive efficiency is then regarded as representing TFP growth, which can be further decomposed into efficiency change (catch-up) and technical progress (frontier-shift). Several ideas and methods have been proposed to incorporate undesirable outputs into DEA approaches while assuming asymmetrical treatments of disposability between desirable outputs and undesirable outputs when production possibilities are defined [9]. An efficiency improvement strategy for inefficient DMUs is developed by holding one or two inputs, desirable outputs or undesirable outputs constant. For example, input orientation refers to a strategy that considers how much inputs can be reduced while holding both desirable and undesirable outputs unchanged (i.e., [10]). Some others suggest a bads orientation strategy, which considers how bads can be reduced while holding inputs and desirable outputs unchanged (i.e., [11]). Tyteca [11] also considers the third strategy, which examines how much bads and inputs can be reduced while holding desirable outputs unchanged. The other recent strategy to incorporate undesirable outputs is to consider the proportional reduction in inputs and undesirable outputs and the proportional increase in desirable outputs [12]. Based on the earlier method of simultaneous change in desirable outputs and undesirable outputs following a hyperbolic function where fixed inputs are assumed, Chung et al. [13] proposed an application of a directional distance function as well as a productivity index known as the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. The directional distance function (DDF) defines a strategy in which desirable and undesirable outputs are simultaneously changed. While the efficiency measurement with a DDF model in a single year is measured as the Luenberger productivity index, an alternate application of the DDF model between t and t + 1 to measure the Luenberger productivity index in such a way that a Malmquist productivity index is constructed can generate the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. Therefore, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index can be further decomposed into efficiency change (catch-up) and technical progress (frontier-shift). Since Chung et al. [13] reported empirical results for Swedish firms in the paper and pulp industry using the directional distance function to develop the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index has been widely used in various studies at different levels from micro (firm-level data), to industry (sector-level data), to macro (province, national, and regional-level data) for evaluating productivity changes considering undesirable outputs. Färe et al. [14] employ the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index to study the US manufacturing sector from 1974 to 1986 and observed that average annual productivity growth was 3.6 % when both desirable and undesirable outputs were considered, whereas it was 1.7 % when undesirable outputs were ignored. A comparable finding was presented by [15], who employed a similar approach to estimate productivity growth for six US chemical industries for the period 1988 to 1993; they concluded that environmental protection measures did not reduce productivity growth. Several other studies, including He et al. [16] and Piot-Lepetit and Moing [17] have focused on micro-level issues, while Kumar [18], Oh [19], and Zhang et al. [20] focused on macro-level issues using state- and regional-level data. Furthermore, the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index has also been applied to industrial-level issues by Boyd et al. [21], Heng et al. [22], and Krautzberger and Wetzel [23]. TFP growth might be greater or smaller when undesirable outputs are considered compared to TFP measurement without considering undesirable outputs. Table 3 compiles several studies that analyze and examine TFP growth using the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index with various topics, variables, and time periods. The results are discussed based on environmental regulation being the key determinant of the difference in productivity measurements with and without undesirable outputs. Chung et al. [13], Kumar [18], and He et al. [16] confirmed that TFP growth is higher when undesirable outputs are considered under stringent environmental regulations. However, these findings contrast with Zhang et al. [20], who analyzed TFP growth in China’s 30 provincial regions, implying that environmental regulations are not very stringent or not strictly enforced. Further indexing of TFP is proposed by Färe et al. [10] to elucidate the net contribution of environmental factors to productivity growth. Following this concept, Managi and Jena [24] estimate the ratio of TFP considering CO2 emissions to TFP without considering CO2 emissions as an environmental productivity measurement, which is referred to as the TFP environment. An increase in the TFP environment is considered to represent a positive achievement of proactive environmental measures or how well environmentally friendly technologies and managements are utilized [25].",

4.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,11 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-015-0012-9,A productivity analysis considering environmental pollution and diseases in China,December 2015,Huijuan Cao,Hidemichi Fujii,Shunsuke Managi,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Over the previous three decades, China has achieved dramatic economic development. However, this growth has been characterized by alarming and sometimes hidden imbalances in development across different provinces, between rural and urban regions, and even among areas within the same province [1]. Due to their different physical geography and population characteristics, the central and western regions of China have fallen behind the eastern region with respect to both economic and social development. This gap has particularly widened since the 1990s. Moreover, foreign direct investment (FDI) provides tremendous contributions to development [2]. Environmental pollution is also becoming a serious social issue in China. This pollution is related to rapid industrial growth, and the main pollutants are waste gas emission and wastewater discharge [3, 4]. Air pollution causes damage to a variety of aspects of human health (e.g., the cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems) and increases the risk of lung cancer and adverse birth outcomes [5]. Water pollution is also related to damage to human health. Drinking water with high concentrations of bacteria will increase the risk of infectious diseases (e.g., cholera and dysentery). These diseases are more common in poor rural regions of China, due to the lack of water sanitation in these areas. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and the Chinese Ministry of Health indicate that 40 % of rural residents and 62 % of urban residents in China may be exposed to significant risks of infectious disease due to unsafe drinking water. Furthermore, wastewater that has been contaminated by industrial pollutants may produce cancers of the digestive system (e.g., stomach, liver, esophagus, and colorectal cancers). Although the size of the population affected by this type of water pollution is unknown, based on data from the Chinese Ministry of Health, it is estimated that 11 % of total digestive system cancer cases are caused by industrial water pollution. In other words, wastewater treatment systems play an important role in environmental and health considerations. Since China adopted its “reform and opening up” policy in 1978, its medical care system and the health of its residents have rapidly improved. In 1978, despite its low-income conditions, China underwent its first health revolution. The changes of this revolution focused on public medical care services, particularly water sanitation improvement and medical insurance [6]. However, China’s experience demonstrates that economic growth alone does not generate health improvements for all [1]. Similarly to economic growth, human health status is also characterized by regional disparities. Individuals from relatively poorer regions with worse overall living conditions lack safe drinking water, health care information, and the ability to engage in private medical care expenditures and hospital access. Furthermore, poor living conditions are associated with higher risks of infectious diseases, such as cholera, dysentery and measles. Because it recognizes that public health plays an important role in improving social welfare, the Chinese government has made the protection of health and safety one of its foremost priorities, particularly since the SARS crisis of 2003 [1]. The Disease Emergence and Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System began operating in China at the end of 2003. The government’s overall investment in health care has increased, and public health and clinical service delivery systems are being developed in both urban and rural areas. Additionally, the “Go West” policy has focused on promoting development in the western region of China with greater levels of support from the central government, and the New Rural Cooperative Medical System has been introduced [7]. Furthermore, the China People’s Daily published an article entitled “Report of local government and official performance evaluation in China” in 2008, which indicated that other important factors in addition to the GDP should be used as measuring indices. There are several indicators to measure the performance of local government. For example, harmony of the society, work ethic and morality, environmental quality, etc. [8]. Health damage can also be measured in terms of economic losses. Kira et al. [9] demonstrated that air pollution has created a substantial socioeconomic burden for China’s economy. They considered the losses in consumption and social welfare which were produced by health damage from air pollution. In particular, they considered health damage in terms of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, according to Kan and Chen [10], in Shanghai, total economic cost of health impacts due to air pollution was 625.40 million US dollars in 2001, accounting for 1.03 % of gross domestic product of that city. Furthermore, medical cost due to health problems also leads to productivity loss. According to neoclassical economic theory, the concept of productivity is based on the production function, where output is a function of capital and labor input. Productivity is a measure of output per unit of input. Labor input reflects the quantity (e.g., time) and quality (e.g., effort and skills) of the work force. Productivity loss due to health problems refers to the output loss corresponding to the reduced labor input due to health problems [11]. Economic growth, better environmental conditions, and improved public health will improve social welfare. Therefore, policymaking should not only focus on economic growth but also address environmental protection and public health preservation. We focus on these three areas of interest: economic, environment, and health. This research paper is unique in that there is no previous study that simultaneously considers all three of these fields. In step 1 of this study, to measure social welfare, we estimate the productive inefficiency in each area of China, considering both environmental pollution and disease. We also seek to estimate the individual inefficiency scores of specific social welfare indicators, including economic growth, environmental pollution, and disease. In other words, we attempt to simultaneously estimate both the maximum expansion of the economy and the maximum reduction in pollution emissions and disease cases. In step 2 of this study, we attempt to identify exogenous factors for improving social welfare by creating a better living environment and health conditions. On the whole, we will estimate the major influences on aggregate productive inefficiency and the individual inefficiency of different social welfare indicators. This research focuses on regional differences in productive inefficiency and clarifies the determinants of this inefficiency. In particular, economic, environment, and health considerations are addressed. This investigation is accomplished through the use of provincial data for 29 areas in China from 2003 to 2009. There are previous studies of economic, environmental, and health issues in China, as discussed below. However, it is difficult to find any research that simultaneously addresses all three of these fields. Nan and Gao [12] observe that environmental pollution has become an important constraint on China’s economic growth and that high levels of energy consumption are an important driver of environmental pollution. Kan et al. [13] suggest that a consideration of the health impacts of air pollution, which is associated with fossil fuel use, can facilitate progress towards sustainable development. Similarly to Kan et al. [13], many other studies also explore the links between air pollution and public health. In particular, to addressing the short-run connections between these topics, a number of daily time-series and case-crossover studies have been conducted in large Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Anshan [13]. However, only one published air pollution cohort study has examined the long-run connections between air pollution and public health in China [14]. Liu and Griffiths [1] reveal the relationship between economic development and public health and discuss a series of issues that relate to health disparities. In particular, they offer the following claims. (1) In China, regional disparities contribute to problems with human health. (2) Poor living conditions are associated with a higher risk of contracting infectious diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, and measles. (3) Private medical expenditures fell by 19 %, and private spending on critical illnesses decreased by 36 % after the enrollment of Chinese citizens in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme, which began in 2003 and sought to include all Chinese residents by 2010. Additionally, Kan and Chen [10], estimate the total economic cost of health impacts due to particulate air pollution in urban areas of Shanghai in 2001. The result shows that it is approximately 625.40 million US dollars, accounting for 1.03 % of gross domestic product of the city. They suggested that the impact of particulate air pollution on human health could be substantial in urban Shanghai, both in physical and economic terms. In this research, the health outcomes are estimated for number of disease cases associated with air pollution. Furthermore, Lybarger et al. [15] estimate the expected medical costs as economic loss and the average costs of productivity loss, which are associated with volatile organic compounds in drinking water in the US. In this research, lost productivity is accounted for the work time loss while obtaining inpatient or outpatient care. Several research papers examine whether education has a positive or negative effect on economic growth. The results of these studies are dependent on the specific situation. Zhang and Zhuang [16] demonstrate that only the average number of years of schooling produces a positive effect on economic growth in China. Other factors, such as the literacy rate and the enrollment rate in higher-level education, are not statistically significant drivers of economic growth. Furthermore, Zhang and Zhuang [16] also show that in relatively rich areas of China (most of which are in eastern China), higher education (i.e., a college education) produces a stronger effect on economic growth. By contrast, in relatively poor areas (which are mostly in western China), lower-level education (i.e., a primary education) generates a stronger effect on economic growth. Sanjeev et al. [17] demonstrate that in developing countries, education level positively affects public health. In particular, increases in the adult literacy rate produce sharply lower infant and child mortality rates and less dramatic reductions in total mortality rates. Furthermore, increased public medical expenditures as a share of GDP also generate reductions in infant and child mortality. However, only a weak relationship exists between medical expenditures and the mortality rates of the entire population. A number of research papers conclude that poverty and income levels have relatively strong impacts on health care, whereas changes in public medical expenditures produce a relatively weak impact on this issue [18]. In other words, stronger impacts on human health are generated by private medical expenditures than by public medical expenditures. Additionally, Lauter and Moreaub [19] pointed out that FDI attraction has become a priority of development agendas in developing country. Development strategies used to focus on state’s investments and interventions; FDI is now considered as the main source of catching-up and technological development. Wang et al. [20] use panel data from 287 Chinese cities over the period 1999–2005 and assess the multiple impacts of FDI in both positive and negative domains. They conclude that FDI enhances economic growth, labor productivity, and innovation but also causes employment reduction and environmental pollution. To measure pollution intensity of a city, they use data of total factory SO2 emission divided by land area (tons/square kilometer), based on the reports by China’s environmental protection agency. To achieve our research aims, we offer the following three hypotheses, which are based on the results of various previous studies. (H1) FDI may negatively affect productive inefficiency but may positively affect inefficiencies that are associated with emissions of waste gas and wastewater. (H2) Investments in pollution abatement may negatively affect the inefficiencies that are associated with waste gas and wastewater. (H3) Private medical expenditures may negatively affect the inefficiency levels of various types of patients and infectious diseases.",2

According to Heaps (2008), LEAP is a standard tool that enables countries to contact integrated resource planning, greenhouse gases (GHG), mitigation assessments, and low-emission development strategies (LEDS). Furthermore, several countries have been based on LEAP’s output in order to report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). There are various studies in Greece that have been conducted in order to provide the literature with long-term projections in the energy sector using LEAP (among others, Papagiannis et al. 2008; Giatrakos et al. 2009; Roinioti et al. 2012). According to Bhattacharyya and Timilsina (2010), LEAP is based on the accounting framework in order to generate energy demand (and supply) and on the physical description of the examined energy system. Furthermore, on their extensive review Bhattacharyya and Timilsina (2010) emphasize the fact that LEAP is based on the scenario approach in order for several paths of energy system evolution to be developed. According to Heaps (2002), the forecast of the energy demand is based on the effect of alternative market shares, whereas the supply side is based on a what-if analysis and possible development scenarios which LEAP integrates through simulation and accounting approaches. Our paper constructs four different scenarios for the period 1990–2030 in order to evaluate the demand of Greek energy derived from renewable energy sources (RES) and the GHG emissions generated over the same period for the sectors of industry, transport, and energy. Therefore, in the first stage, the paper forecasts the energy demand derived from renewable sources alongside the generated GHG emissions (under the four scenarios). Furthermore, in the second stage analysis, it applies a nonparametric estimator based on the mathematical approach known as data envelopment analysis (DEA)1 in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Greek renewable energy policies imposed under the Law L3851/2010 which was introduced in order to comply with the European targets set in 2007 and in 2014.2 As a result, the paper presents a way for evaluating the efficiency of the future implementation of renewable energy policies, which in our case have been set by the Greek government and under four different energy-based scenarios. The article is constructed as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the relative literature, the four scenarios for the Greek energy sector and the nonparametric methodology adopted. Section 3 presents the empirical findings, whereas, the last section concludes the paper.",7

Foster-McGregor et al. [1], OECD-WTO [2] with the fragmentation of production processes across borders and the intensification of interconnectedness within supply chains, notably in East Asia, the importance of trade in intermediates has increased significantly in both goods and services trade. Hayakawa [3], Meng et al. [4], Miroudot et al. [5] official statistics on gross trade such as customs-clearance statistics include both final products and intermediates. The picture given by gross trade can be quite different from that by trade in value added; since in today’s production networks in East Asia, it is possible that the same intermediate goods and services are recorded many times as they go through customs. Value added generated by both domestic and foreign final demand, on the other hand, is more closely related with wages and employment, corporate profits, tax revenues, and finally national income. Data on gross exports and imports, however, are no less useful than before because they are indispensable to understand the technological structure of the cross-border production processes. This study exploits a four region-country input-output system consisting of major Asian economies and the US, which builds upon the Asian International Input-Output Tables (AIO) for 1995, 2000, and 2005 constructed by the Institute of Developing Economies. (Institute of Developing Economies [6–8]) Section 2 describes the analytical framework of this study to compare trade in gross terms and value-added terms in the four-region system and to make inter-temporal factor decomposition of trade in value added during the 1995–2005 decade. It also contains the construction of data. Section 3 presents the main results of the analysis. Section 4 concludes.",2

With this treaty it was hoped that, particularly in Mexico, greater economic growth, employment, and wage rates would be observed. Today, after more than 20 years after the beginning of the agreement, the Mexican economy has not achieved greater growth rates, and in fact, they are below those observed during the 1950–1980 time period. Annual average growth rates for the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were around 6.5%, and after the so-called lost decade of the 1980s, the higher annual average growth rate was the one observed in the 1990s at 3.4%, a decade in which the largest volume of foreign trade was achieved.Footnote 1
  The literature on the reasons why the Mexican economy has lagged behind the expected growth rates dwells on the need of deeper reforms, but also on the possibility that it was the way the nation entered the world economy the fact that helps to explain the lack of economic performance of the latter years. From the analysis of the Global Value Chains (GVCs) and the way Mexico participates in them, this research estimates the domestic value added contained in trade flows between the NAFTA members, its distribution in labor and capital compensations, and its employment content (measured as the volume of persons engaged), in order to validate the second explanation given above, as one of the main reasons why Mexico’s economic performance has not being as expected. The main goal is to show not only that, when the largest share of the volume of foreign trade is constituted by intermediate goods and raw materials, a double accounting problem in trade flows is observed, but also that production specialization and trade of goods with a low value-added content impose an additional restriction to the “export-led growth strategies”Footnote 2 and that, through factorial distribution of income as a consequence of exports and median income, it can also be explained how exports growth did not contribute to the growth of the Mexican economy significantly. The rest of the document is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, a brief literature review on the theoretical aspects of free trade advantages, free trade agreements, and trade evolution between the NAFTA members is made. Section 3 describes the method used in the estimation of the account balances of trade flows between the NAFTA members in terms of value added, its distribution as payments to factors of production, and its employment content. In Sect. 4, the estimation results for the total amount of value added, in both the intermediate and final goods trade flows, as well as its distribution in compensations to capital or labor, are reported. In Sect. 5 a brief balance of persons engaged, directly or indirectly, in the intra-NAFTA trade is made; also, some evidence of wider gaps in the average labor compensations per hour by skill level is showed. In the last section we conclude. Since the publication of An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith (2008, [1776]) it has been discussed that production specialization and free trade are both essential aspects for the better use of available and scarce resources. In an oversimplified way, it is supposed that, if every individual exclusively does what it does best, more production can be achieved and, through free trade, each participant obtains more and better goods and services than without such free trade. However, the economic systems in which goods and services are traded through monetary payments are complex systems in which, during the resource allocation; the production volume; and the price determination processes; multiple and dynamic relationships can be observed between buyers and producers of raw materials, capital and consumption goods, financial services and labor. The latter implies that in the development of free trade theory more elements that help understanding free trade advantages, at both an individual and economic system levels, functioning with different currencies, had to be introduced. After Smith, David Ricardo, around 1821, introduces the concept of the comparative advantage in order to highlight that, even when a particular agent or economic system do not possess an absolute advantage, gains can still be obtained if each agent or system focuses on the production of that in which is relatively better at. Furthermore, in the first decades of the twentieth century, Eli Hecksher and Bertil Ohlin noticed that, when trade is present between economies, the relative endowments of factors of production and natural resources constitute the basis of trade advantages through relative prices of factors of productionFootnote 3 and of different forms of production that require a relatively more intensive use of any given factor, depending on the good being produced. From the latter, the Hecksher–Ohlin theorem is derived, according to which free trade advantages will also lead economies to a productive specialization. Such specialization is a consequence of economies being relatively labor-abundant produce more labor-intensive goods, while those economies with a relatively more abundant endowment of capital produce capital-intensive goods. Moreover, through the Leontief paradox and Paul Krugman’s elaborations, among others, more elements were added to the analysis of international trade and its advantages, such as the possibility of allowing, besides labor and capital, specialized labor in the production of capital-intensive goods and the achievement of economies of scale, which would explain the benefits of free trade between countries with similar factors of production endowments and trade under imperfect competition settings. On the other hand, in works by List (1997, [1841]) and Prebish (1949), arguments are put forward that are contrary to the idea that international trade without barriers is always advantageous for those economies involved. For List, free trade can represent a threat to the development of poor economies if such trade impairs the development of productive capabilities. That is, instead of considering trade as one of the causes of the “wealth of nations,” the author argues that the main cause of the wealth of nations is the enhancement of domestic production, institutional and political processes that enable the achievement of wealth, so that once such wealth is achieved, through trade, more benefits can be obtained. From List’s arguments on the need of protecting domestic industries, it can be thought of a dynamic version of the H–O model that would allow the distinction between the assumption of “a given relative endowment of factors of production” and the assumptions on the conditions that allow the accumulation of such factors, particularly capital and human capital. For Prebish, and the Latin-American structuralism (Rodriguez 2006), the deterioration of the terms of trade is a risk that developing economies face when participating in international trade with the more developed ones. From the latter, additional considerations are introduced into the forms of production, on both the supply and demand sides, that might affect the gains derived from trade. It is argued that, for example, a differentiated productivity growth of tradable goods would make median income to increase to a lesser rate than in those economies specialized in the production and commercialization of goods with a lower productivity growth rate (i.e., raw materials). Hence, trade advantages would not be obtained given lower levels of relative income. As for the demand side, different income elasticities of tradable goods demand would make that the median income of the economies specialized in the production and commercialization of low demand-income elasticity goods or low demand-price elasticity of exports, but high-income elasticity of imports, explain why international trade gains can be lower for these economies when observing lower growth rates. Thus, by adding to the Kaldor–Dixon–Thirwall model (see Thirwall 2013) the elements from the deterioration of the terms of trade thesis, if productivity is a consequence of income growth (Verdoon Law) and income is conditional on the terms of trade, free trade could lead not only to a divergence process between developed and developing economies but to the economic stagnation of the latter. That is, in the non-static analysis of the consequences of trade liberalization, it must be considered which ones are the determinants of both productivity and income growth. The latter given that it is through income growth that companies guarantee their profits in order to achieve capital accumulation. In the value-added content analysis made in Cervantes and Villaseñor (2014), following the Kaldor–Dixon–Thirwall model, it is also argued that distinguishing between the gross value of exports and the domestic value-added content in them allows for a better understanding of the conditions that must be attained in order for free trade, through exports growth, to translate into larger economic growth rates. Furthermore, it is also argued that the analysis of the benefits of free trade that focus on the idea of final goods trade is inadequate given the twenty-first century trade patterns, in which it is not only wine or cheese that its being traded, or just manufactured goods using raw materials, but goods that are used in many stages of the production process. That is, through the analysis of international trade in terms of value added (see OECD–WTO 2012 and Stehrer et al. 2013, and Gereffi 2013, among others) the estimation of the form in which the final value of finished goods is added, or the way in which the gains from trade are distributed in the form of payments to the factors of production, through direct or indirect trade of goods and services, is attempted. Moreover, for Gereffi (2013: 11) and Kaplinsky (2000), the new trade patterns derived from the growth of the global production nets (GPNs) and “the dynamics of profits in global value chains” had been associated with “growth in income inequality levels,” both between individuals and between nations. And, it is possible that the distribution patterns that have led to this growth in inequality affect the conditions that allow increasing the domestic demand of the nations involved, through the consumption and demand of investment goods. Regarding free trade agreements, it was in Mexico in the mid-1980s when the liberalization of the economic activity begun and would be the basis for the signing of 11 free trade agreements, of which only one has not come into force. The latter amount of treaties implies that Mexico has preferential trade agreements with more than 40 nations, including most of the largest economies in the world. However, by signing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Mexico trade barriers and tariffs for imports were unilaterally and significantly reduced: Maximum and weighted average tariffs went from 100 and 23.5% to 20 and 12.5%, respectively, between June 1985 and June 1990; while the share of tradable goods production subject to import permits went from 92.2 to 19.9% in the same period (Clavijo and Valdivieso 2000: 16). Thus, the negotiations for the signing of NAFTA initiated when the nation had already made significant advancements in the liberalization of its foreign trade, the latter being for some authors, the proof that these kinds of treaties are more related to the integration processes of the production systems than with the free exchange of merchandise. As an example, Puyana (2003) suggests that NAFTA, the treaty with the European Union, and the free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association are all projects that aim to achieve more freedom for foreign investment, which would also explain the way Mexico participates in the GVCs and the income distribution derived from exports. Hence, with data from the WIOD, in gross terms, from 1995 to 2011, the trade balances between NAFTA members have been increasing in favor of surpluses for Canada and Mexico with the USA and of Mexico with Canada (see Fig. 1). In 1995 the exports surplus of Canada to the USA and of Mexico to the USA were of 30,351 and 4276 million dollars, respectively, while the surplus of Mexico with Canada was of 1692 million dollars. By 2011, the amounts increased to 66,414, 60,211, and 10,386 million dollars, respectively. As it can be observed, the more significant increases were those of in favor of the Mexican economy. Bilateral exports balances of NAFTA members, 1995–2011 (millions of dollars) From Table 1 and Fig. 2, it can also be observed that, of the exports between the NAFTA members, in average, 60% is of intermediate goods. And, during the whole period, the USA is the largest exporter of intermediate goods with, approximately, 44% of the total exports and 63.5% of its total exports. However, the trade balances change when breaking down these two exports categories. Particularly, from 1995 to 2003, Mexico had a deficit in trade of intermediate goods with the USA, while from 2003 onward most of the surplus of Canada would be explained by the surplus derived from the trade of intermediate goods with the USA. Bilateral exports balances of NAFTA members by type of exports, 1995–2011 (millions of dollars) By the type of product at industry level, Table 2 shows that, in average, from 1995 to 2001 between the three nations, the greater volume of trade is concentrated in exports of manufactured goods. However, for the USA, almost half of its total exports to its commercial partners are in the form of intermediate goods from manufacturing industries, particularly high-technology goods. Mexico is also the nation in which raw materials exports are higher, in the form of both intermediate and final goods. As for Canada, the greatest volume of its exports are from intermediate goods as manufactures, but differently from the USA, such volume is much more concentrated toward the export of mid-technology and natural resources-based manufactures. These trade patterns between NAFTA members not only illustrate the kind of trade derived from vertical specialization, but that it is possible from a given form of task distribution in the productive process to generate the gains from trade. The latter being, according to Gereffi (2014), a U form pattern for the relationship between tasks or stages of the productive process and the generation of value added, a pattern that would also be subject to changes derived from technological development, but that actually indicates that the first stages of the productive process involve research and development, other products design, and purchasing logistics; in this order the value added goes from more to less until reaching the tasks that remunerate the less to the factors of production which would be the actual production tasks (transformation) and assembling so that once the products are made, the logistics of selling (distribution), marketing, and after-purchase service start to generate more value added. In the following section, a description of the methods used to break down the value of exports intra-NAFTA in terms of value added and by country of origin of the factors of production, is given. And, in the next sections we will focus on the difference between the bilateral balances in gross exports and in value added, since for Mexico most of its volume of commerce is intra-NAFTA, in order to show that even if the gross balances of trade and the value-added balances are only different in bilateral terms; these differences could be important in place and time for economies that are mostly integrated to one partner.",3

Lahr,Moisés Vassallo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Economic development occurs unevenly across geographic space. Indeed, almost all nations can identify both more-developed and less-developed regions. Egypt is no exception: it is characterized by a high concentration of production factors and resources in governorates comprising the greater Nile delta—Lower Egypt. These concentrations parallel and perhaps even cause the nation’s uneven distribution of wealth and population across regions. The interregional wealth disparity crops up in the form of other socio-economic conditions, ranging from health and education to labor market conditions (World Bank 2012). Interest by policymakers on regional issues within Egypt has been recently renewed with the publication of the World Bank (2012) report Reshaping Egypt’s Economic Geography: Domestic Integration as a Development Platform. It investigates Egypt’s regional economic growth, explores the causes for geographically unbalanced development, and proposes policy options to make unbalanced growth compatible with inclusive development. Spatially connective infrastructure is a primary pillar for future policies to address the country’s spatial disparities. In a context of growing global integration and increasing international competition, new challenges are likely to emerge in Egypt’s regional economies. It is hoped that they may be partially addressed via integration of the nation’s economic periphery and core. One way to better integrate the nation is to improve its transportation network. This paper focuses on the potential regional impacts of domestic integration on regional inequality in Egypt. It looks not only at the domestic integration of the country by improving links among regions’ domestic demanders and suppliers, but also by improving the nation’s links to the broader world economy. The Egyptian economy is not internally homogenous. It presents variations across both industries and regions. Thus, it is expected that the impact of economic policies will vary across different governorates (mohaafazaat). In the context of renewed attention to the spatial aspects of economic development, both from a theoretical perspective (Fujita and Krugman 2004) and from a policy perspective (World Bank 2009), there is a growing need for economic and socio-economic models that could provide new insights into the nation’s regional planning process. In this paper, we develop one such tool: an interregional computable general equilibrium (ICGE) model for Egypt. The work is based on previous work by Haddad (1999), Lahr (2001), Haddad and Hewings (2005), Álvarez-Martínez and Lahr (2013) and Haddad (2014a, b). The consequent model is developed with an eye toward gaining added insight to the ex ante assessment of domestic integration policies in the country. As highlighted in Haddad et al. (2011a, p. 45), modeling of transportation costs provides an important way of dealing explicitly with theoretical issues related to integrated regional systems. The explicit modeling of transportation costs in the ICGE model, which is based on origin–destination flows, organically will take into account the spatial structure of the Egyptian economy. That is, the ICGE model is integrated with a stylized geo-coded transportation network model, thereby augmenting the general model framework for understanding the role of infrastructure investment in regional economic development. There are important proposals of infrastructure projects contemplated in the Egyptian government’s five-year plan—such as the Cairo–Asyout road improvement, the Suhag-Red Sea improvement, and the Cairo Ring Road improvement. For the sake of future fiscal and policy decisions, their ex ante impacts ought to be assessed (Felkner et al. 2012). To examine possible spatial effects of transportation cost reductions in Egypt induced by transportation infrastructure improvements, we adopt a cost-competitiveness approach. It reviews possible relative changes in the regional costs and on different demand structures. Following Haddad et al. (2011), we scrutinize the link between the freeness of trade and the equilibrium distribution of activities. It is clear from many prior studies (Yang and Lahr 2008; Aroca et al. 2008; Hu and McAleer 2004) that domestic economic integration is effected by reducing transportation costs. There is no reason to expect this should not be the case among Egyptian regions. For our model, we adopt a broad concept of market access and supplier areas that includes both domestic and foreign trade. To calibrate the ICGE model, we employ a fully specified interregional input–output system that includes commodity flows across Egypt’s regions as well as to the rest of the world. Moreover, we allow labor and capital to be mobile; this also spurs interregional integration. In what follows, Sect. 2 introduces the main features of the ICGE model. Section 3 is a discussion of the details of how we modeled transportation costs and integrated the ICGE model via a stylized network using GIS techniques. In Sects. 4 and 5, we design and simulate two experiments and discuss the main results. Final remarks follow in an attempt to evaluate our findings and put them into perspective, considering their extension and limitations.",3
5.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,27 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-016-0057-4,A social accounting matrix for Iraq,December 2016,Dario Debowicz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Iraq is an oil-exporting economy with a GDP per capita of around 6500 USD and a low inflation rate (below 2 % in 2014), which attracts more than 1 billion dollars a year in foreign direct investment. However, the economy is strongly dependent on its oil sector, and almost a quarter of its population is poor (Table 1; Fig. 1). The increasing perception of oil dependency as a structural problem of the economy has recently led the international community to support efforts for an inclusive diversification of the economy (IMF 2015). To assess the expected quantitative effects of such a diversification effort on its economy, we need a social accounting matrix (SAM) for the country. 
Source: author’s based on CSO (2013) Sector shares in Iraq’s value added 2012. From their inception, SAMs have been instrumental in considering how different counterfactuals can affect the economy in terms of its total production, the participation of different sectors and production factors in its value added, its pattern of international trade, and the distribution of income among its institutions. SAMs record the transactions that take place in an (usually national) economy during a period of time (usually a year). As documented by Kehoe (1996), the origin of SAMs can be traced back at least until Quesnay’s (1759) Tableau économique. Subsequent contributions from Kuznets (1937), Leontief (1941), and Meade and Stone (1941) paved the ground for Stone (1947) to set the main conventions for social accounting, embedded in the United Nations System of National Accounts that is used until present. Against this historical background, the first SAM was generated by the Cambridge Growth Project (Stone et al. 1962) and was used to inform the Cambridge Growth model (Stone and Brown 1962), which in turn allowed investigating the implications of different growth strategies in the UK with assumptions that diverged from the well-established neoclassical paradigm (Ramanathan 1982). As documented by Round (2003), SAMs were then “further developed and used to help address poverty and income distribution issues in developing countries” by many researchers. In particular, after the seminal work conducted by Pyatt and Thorbecke (1976) at the ILO, a large number of SAM-based multiplier studies followed, some of the earliest being for Sri Lanka (Pyatt and Round 1979), Botswana (Hayden and Round 1982), Korea (Defourny and Thorbecke 1984), Indonesia (Thorbecke et al. 1992) and, more recently, Ghana (Powell and Round 2000) and Vietnam (Tarp et al. 2002). In all of these studies, the aim has been to examine the nature of the multiplier effects of an income injection in one part of an economic system on the economic structure and the functional and institutional distribution in general and on the incomes of socioeconomic groups of households in particular. More recently, SAMs were extended to account for environmental issues, including for developing economy settings such as Indonesia (Resosudarmo and Thorbecke 1996), China (Xie 2000), and Brazil (Lenzen and Schaeffer 2004). The economy of Iraq lacks a SAM, making it difficult—if not impossible—to assess in a quantitative way the expected countrywide effects of relevant counterfactuals such as the diversification strategy proposed by the recent Iraq National Development Plan 2013–2017 (IMoP 2013), or different scenarios regarding conflict in the country. This paper seeks to fill this gap. The novelty of the work is not on analytical methods, but on dealing with the challenges associated with a particular application of SAM generation in a context where up-to-date measured data are scarce. Our paper is organized in the following ways. In Sect. 2, we explain our approach to estimating the SAM for Iraq based on the best available information, which includes the use of sensitivity analysis to assess the role of uncertainty in the measurement of its underlying data, in Sect. 3, we analyze the structure of the Iraqi economy based on the resulting SAM, in Sect. 4, we consider the effects of the present government’s economic diversification strategy via conducting a SAM-based semi-input–output analysis, and the final section concludes.",3

Leontief (1906–1999), is an effective tool to evaluate the mutual spatial effects of regional economies. I–O analysis is a systematic tool to analyze the relationship between industries through the production activities of each industry in a nation and region. To this day, the tool is used for empirical and advanced research. In Japan, the I–O table is compiled by prefectures, government-designated cities, and the national government, and an analysis based on the I–O table is used widely. Because the main purpose of I–O analysis is to discuss the money flows or exchanges between only industries, this analysis does not consider all money flows, such as money exchanges with institutional sectors (household, company, and central and local governments) and fund flows with capital accounts (saving/investment).Footnote 1
 To meet this challenge, the social accounting matrix (SAM), developed by Sir J. Richard N. Stone (1913–1991),Footnote 2 uses the I–O table as a basis to indicate all money exchanges at the same point in time and covers the activities of all economic agents: industry, capital, household, company, government, and the rest of the world (ROW). Therefore, the SAM at the level of a country or region shows the economic size and all money exchanges at each sector in that country or region. The aim of this study is to introduce an analytical framework of interregional SAM (ISAM) focusing on institutional sectors based on data availability in Japan. In addition, the study aims to evaluate SAM multipliers and the regional and interregional spillover effects of economic impacts by using (spatial) structural path analysis (SPA), which is one tool of structural decomposition analyses (SDAs), for an ISAM constructed. The following two points summarize the contribution of this study. First, the construction of ISAM focuses on detailed institutional sectors. ISAM constructed in early research (Itoh 2008b) essentially has four main categories as institutional sectors: household, company, local government, and saving/investment. Moreover, the ISAM proposed in this study has much more detailed categories, especially for companies and governments. For example, by applying this ISAM for empirical analysis, we can analyze the interdependent relationships between social security funds, taxes, and subsidies in local and central governments. In addition, because the ISAM constructed in the early research is based on the lists of more detailed income/expenditure following the system of national accounts (SNA) in Japan, balanced adjustments of the data gaps of sectors on ISAM are quite easy. The second contribution is that this empirical study applies SPA for ISAM in the flow analysis of spillover effects for regional incomes. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of regional economic spillover mechanisms for household incomes in regions based on the ISAM database with Hokkaido prefecture and the rest of Japan (ROJ). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the purpose and orientation of this research. Section 3 shows the frameworks of intraregional and interregional SAMs and proposes an ISAM with detailed institutional sectors by introducing the data possibilities of SNA in Japan. Moreover, this section provides an ISAM with two regions, focusing on Hokkaido prefecture. Next, Sect. 4 explains the method of spatial SPA, discusses the detailed regional and interregional economic spillover effects, and analyzes the results of the numerical example of the Hokkaido ISAM. Lastly, Sect. 5 concludes the research and gives direction for further research.",8

5.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,19 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-016-0050-y,"Labour productivity convergence and structural changes: simultaneous analysis at country, regional and industry levels",December 2016,Amjad Naveed,Nisar Ahmad,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past two decades, The EU commission’s (2011) main focus has been on reducing regional disparities across EU economies. Usually, the GDP per capita convergence concept has been used in the literature for testing regional disparities or catching-up hypothesis.Footnote 1 A reduction in regional disparities can also be attributed to the enhancement of innovation and technology, narrowing technological gap, improvement in living standards and particularly labour productivity convergence. An increase in labour productivity over the long run not only affects the living standards but also reduces the disparities across regions and countries (Melachroinos and Spence 1999; Filippetti and Peyrache 2013). Furthermore, labour productivity is also affected by the structural change which is defined by a shift of employment from the low sector to the high sector (Van Ark 1995). Moreover, the differences in the levels of labour productivity are still considerable in EU economies; these differences can be attributed to the structural changes that occur over time. These differences in labour productivity exist for most countries at regional and industry levels.Footnote 2 Therefore, the main contribution of the current study is to consider the role of structural change on the process of labour productivity convergence and speed of convergence at country, regional and industry levels. The reason for doing analysis at various levels is that there exists heterogeneity in labour productivity across regions and industries.Footnote 3
 The convergence debate was started by Abramovitz (1986), Baumol (1986), Dollar and Wolff (1988), Dollar (1993), Barro and Sala i Martin (1992), Quah (1993, 1996), O’Leary (1997) and Doyle and O’Leary (1999), and has continued ever since. Most of the studies on this issue have tested the convergence separately between countries, regions and industries and have reached different conclusions. For example, some studies found a greater degree of convergence at the aggregate (country) level than at the disaggregate (regions and industry) level, while others have found the opposite. For instance, Sondermann (2014) found no convergence at the aggregate level but did find strong evidence of convergence at the disaggregate level for some sectors. Conversely, Bernard and Jones (1996) found convergence at the aggregate level but not at the disaggregate. Furthermore, the results of productivity convergence at different disaggregation levels of sectors and NUTS (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics) also differ from one study to another.Footnote 4 The speed of convergence could also be different because of heterogeneity in labour productivity at different levels of aggregation. For example, in the case of EU economies, regions are more integrated than countries and industries. Therefore, one can expect to find a different speed of convergence across countries, regions and industries. Since there are a much larger number of regional borders than a number of national borders in EU economies, this might be the reason for having different speeds of convergence across different levels. Therefore, the current study will extend the analysis of productivity convergence at all three levels: countries, regions and industry simultaneously. In addition to analysing the productivity convergence, another important idea that gained less attention in the empirical literature is the role of structural changes. Many structural changes have occurred in the EU during the last two decades, for example, there have been changes in employment share in different sectors, in the demand for goods due to technology, in trade patterns and in technology (Chenery et al. 1986). These structural changes may affect the process of convergence. There are very few studies which have discussed and argued that structural changes play an important role in the process of convergence and its speed.Footnote 5 As discussed by Van Ark (1995), structural changes may affect productivity and growth, especially when labour moves from a low-productivity industry to a high-productivity industry, which may increase the overall productivity level. Therefore, another important contribution of this study is to integrate the structural change in testing convergence and its speed. More specifically, the aim of this study is to test the effects of structural changes on labour productivity convergence at aggregate and disaggregate levels. Aggregate level analysis means a panel set-up of 19 EU countries during the period of 1991–2009. The disaggregate level analysis includes the regional-level and industry-level analysis which includes 259 regions and 6 industries for the same 19 EU countries during the period of 1991–2009. The specific objectives of the study are threefold: First, it will investigate whether there is sufficient evidence of convergence after integrating structural change at the country, regional and industry levels. Second, if so, it will investigate whether the speed of convergence changed with (and without) incorporating structural change. Third, it will seek to determine whether the process of convergence found at the aggregate level is also valid at the disaggregate level. Table 1 provides the basic structure of the aggregation levels used in the study. In terms of estimation, usually cross-sectional or time-series methodology has been applied for testing the beta-convergence hypothesis. However, these approaches were heavily criticised in the literature for producing biased results (Quah 1993; Durlauf and Quah 1999; Le Gallo and Dallerba 2008).Footnote 6 Therefore, this study employs most advanced methodological concepts. For estimation purposes, this study used the concept of β convergence as defined by Barro and Sala i Martin (1992) and applied GMM procedure suggested by Anderson and Hsiao (1981) and Arellano and Bond (1991).Footnote 7 Furthermore, the study also used and compared the results with the Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) method for the panel data model. The results of the study show that conditional convergence exists at country, regional and industry levels, but the speed of convergence is different across different aggregation levels. More precisely, after incorporating structural change, the speed of convergence at regional levels is faster than at the country and industry levels, which shows that structural change plays a very important role in explaining the regional convergence process. The reason for the high convergence rate at a regional level compared to country and industry levels could be that regions are more specialized, united and integrated than the countries. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that without incorporating structural changes into the analysis of productivity convergence, the speed of convergence could be over- or underestimated at the aggregate and disaggregate levels. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the theoretical background and methodology. Section 3 sheds light on data and descriptive statistics. Section 4 reveals the results. Section 5 concludes the discussion.",8

Driven by rapidly growing levels of material consumption in emerging economies together with continued high levels of per capita resource use in the industrialized world, the global economy is also characterized by increasing competition between world regions regarding the access to raw materials. Against this background issues related to material consumption and resource productivity have rapidly increased in importance in European and international policy debates in the past few years. In response to these environmental and economic challenges, numerous policy initiatives have been introduced aiming at significantly increasing resource efficiency to reduce negative environmental impacts, while addressing issues related to material supply security and import dependency. Examples for these strategies on the international level with a strong focus on resource efficiency include the “Green Economy” concept promoted by UNEP (2011b) or the “Green Growth Strategy” of the OECD (2011). The most important policy strategy at the European level promoting resource efficiency is the Commission’s Flagship Initiative “A resource-efficient Europe” (European Commission 2011b) as well as the subsequent “Roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe” (European Commission 2011c), both part of the implementation of the “Europe 2020” strategy. The overall objective of the Roadmap is to ensure that “by 2050 the EU’s economy has grown in a way that respects resource constraints and planetary boundaries” and to identify priority areas and actions “to put us on a path to resource efficient and sustainable growth” (p. 3). Three consumption areas receive particular attention in the Roadmap: food, housing and mobility. The food value chains are identified as causing major global impacts, in particular related to the production of animal-based products. Regarding the housing and building sector, the Commission recognizes the significant material flows related to construction and maintenance activities of buildings. It is argued that the aggregated impacts of housing and infrastructure account for around 15–30 % of all environmental pressures caused by European consumption. The third high-impact area regarding resource use identified in the Roadmap is mobility with its high demand for material-intensive transport infrastructure and the high dependency on fossil fuels. In some consumption areas, notably food consumption, the Commission acknowledges that European consumption causes negative global impacts. In general, however, the Commission is rather concerned about the negative impacts on the EU economy caused by international developments such as restrictions in raw material availability or increasing raw material and food prices (European Commission 2011a). The most prominent related policy strategy focusing on aspects of import dependency, resource supply and access to natural resources is the Raw Materials Initiative (European Commission 2008, 2011d). In these documents, the Commission focuses on critical materials, in particular metal ores with high import dependency rates and high relevance for European industries, and describes measures to secure and improve access to these raw materials. In the initiative, certain materials with specifically high dependency rates are identified, such as indium, titanium and niobium, where the EU faces an import dependency rate of 100 % (European Commission 2008). However, the supply and dependency aspects are solely tackled from a perspective of direct imports and inputs into the European economy, not from a supply chain perspective. Issues such as supply chain security and dependency on indirect supplies via imported manufactured goods are not mentioned. Recently, the EU has also committed itself to the vision of a circular economy and has presented a package of legislative and voluntary measures. This initiative aims at closing the loops of materials and thus maintaining the value of resources and products as long as possible within the economy, while minimizing the amount of generated waste (European Commission 2015). Given the increased demand for robust measures from the policy side, discussions on the most suitable indicators to measure resource use, productivity and criticality of raw materials are intensively ongoing. In recent years, awareness of policy makers generally increased regarding the significance not only of materials and products directly used by a national economy, or a regional economy such as the EU, but also of indirect resource use required along supply chains and embodied in internationally traded products. Consideration of all indirect effects leads to a consumption—or footprint—perspective, allowing illustrating the global impacts related to final demand. As a consequence, there is increasing research on the differences between production-based versus consumption-based trends of material use and its relation to GDP, in order to evaluate whether decoupling is being achieved (UNEP 2011a). Recent results suggest that assessments of decoupling can lead to very different results when measured with different indicators. Industrialized countries and regions, such as the USA or the EU, have in general achieved a relative decoupling when measured with indicators of direct material use, i.e., production-oriented indicators. Some countries, such as Japan, were even able to reduce direct material use in absolute terms (Giljum et al. 2014; Steinberger et al. 2013). However, when consumption-based—or footprint-type—indicators are applied, the decoupling performance is much weaker or even reversed, with material footprints growing faster than GDP (Wiedmann et al. 2015). A rapidly growing body of literature assessing material flows considers indirect material flows embodied in internationally traded products and applies consumption-based or footprint-type indicators with the objective of providing complementary information for the design of resource policies. Studies include national assessments (for example, Kovanda and Weinzettel 2013; Schaffartzik et al. 2014), EU-wide studies (Arto et al. 2012; Schoer et al. 2012) as well as international assessments (for example, Bruckner et al. 2012; Giljum et al. 2015; Wiedmann et al. 2015). Existing studies so far mostly produced aggregated national indicators on material consumption and resource productivity, making it difficult to use MFA results for policy making, which is often focused on specific sectors or consumption areas. The drivers underlying these aggregated indicators as well as the hotspot products and supply chains mostly contributing to the overall results have rarely been investigated (the study by Acosta-Fernández (2007) on identifying sectoral hotspots of material use in the German economy and related priority areas of policy action is one of the very few exceptions). A more detailed understanding of developments on the level of economic sectors and supply chains is essential to identify areas in the production–consumption system, which needs to be transformed, if absolute levels of material consumption should be reduced. Several methods are available to calculate consumption-based MFA indicators, each having its advantages and drawbacks (Lutter et al. 2016; Schoer et al. 2013). Three methodological approaches have been developed and applied so far: coefficient-based approaches building on process analysis, environmental input–output analysis and hybrid approaches combining elements from both approaches. Coefficient-based approaches allow calculating material footprint-type indicators at a very high level of detail, as coefficients can be calculated for a large number of single products without any restrictions of pre-defined sectors or product groups. However, material input coefficients are difficult to calculate for higher manufactured products and services with complex supply chains. Coefficients are often not specific regarding geographical origin of raw materials—in many cases, the geographical origin of a raw material is different to the geographical origin of an imported manufactured good. Furthermore, based on coefficient approaches, it is likely that the calculated total of global environmental pressures related to consumption does not equal the pressures of worldwide production. Input–output analysis, in particular in the context of multi-regional input–output (MRIO) models, has the key advantage of depicting the whole global economy and thus allowing calculating material footprints for all products and sectors independently of the complexity of the underlying supply chains. MRIO models also avoid double counting as supply chains are clearly distinguished from each other. Furthermore, these models allow determining the geographical origin of each raw material related to the final demand of a country or region. For these reasons, in this paper, we apply a MRIO-based approach, based on the database EXIOBASE, which was specifically developed for environmental-related assessments and distinguishes a large number of different raw materials (see Sect. 2 for more details). This paper provides a detailed assessment of the composition of the EU’s material consumption in a global context, with the aim to identify primary product groups contributing to the EU’s global material footprint. We further aim at assessing the supply chain structure of various product groups, thus identifying in which parts of the supply chain major material extractions take place. The temporal and geographical coverage of EXIOBASE further allows for the assessment of changes over time, for example regarding the importance of raw material inputs stemming from non-European countries. This analysis elucidates whether outsourcing of environmental pressures through international trade occurred and illustrates which world regions serve as major suppliers of raw materials directly and indirectly required to satisfy EU’s final demand. Based on the empirical assessment, we aim at reflecting current priority areas of EU resource policy making and at deriving recommendations for the priority areas and topics the EU should focus in its future policy efforts. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 starts with a description of the MRIO and material flow data as well as of the applied analytical methods. Section 3 presents the various results from the MRIO assessment both on the level of overall EU material consumption and on the level of different product groups and their underlying supply chains. It also discusses the results in the context of current EU resource policy priorities. The final Sect. 4 concludes.",44

In addition, this increasing “multi-country nature of single products” (Stehrer et al. 2011: 1) has been accompanied by the establishment of global value chains (Feenstra and Hanson 1996) and worldwide competition thus more and more plays out at the level of production activities within industries and hence, at the level of a single commodity, rather than in competitive advantages between industries (Fujita and Thisse 2006, 2013). A prime example for a globalized industry is the clothing and textile (C&T)-industry, where since the early 1990s increased mechanization and automation processes as well as fundamental changes in the institutional environment have been important drivers for the restructuring of production and trade (Kowalski and Molnár 2009). Particularly noteworthy are the changes in the institutional environment, where the replacement of the 1974 Multifibre Agreement by the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing by the end of 1994 foresaw a full integration of this industry into WTO/GATT by 2005. These changes have led to strong international competition for the European national C&T-industries from low-wage countries (e.g., China entered the WTO in 2000) as C&T-production is a field in which newly industrializing countries are usually quickly entering due to its low capital content. In light of the changing institutional environment and the increased international competition for Europe’s national C&T-industries, the European Commission tried to implement effective policy measures to stabilize the situation of European C&T-production and -trade. In 2003 the European Commission thus initiated a task force, the so-called High Level Group on Textiles and Clothing (European Commission 2004a, b). Discussing the situation observed in European national C&T-industries, the High Level Group emphasizes: “[w]hile the Euro-Mediterranean Zone provides the conditions necessary to allow the sector to remain an important contributor to European industrial production, policymakers cannot ignore the fact that a permanent process of restructuring and modernisation will continue to lead to falling employment [and value added] for some years to come.” (European Commission 2004b: 7, emphasis added) Tying in with this observation, this paper addresses the restructuring of Italy’s and Portugal’s C&T-trade in an international context between the two years 1995 and 2009. The special interest for the development in Italy and Portugal is owed to the hypothesis that C&T-production and accordingly C&T-trade in these two countries are expected to have faced the most intense restructuring. This is due to first, the C&T-industry’s significance for their national economies, and second, these two countries’ role in European C&T-production.Footnote 1 We focus in our empirical analysis on a meso-level, and our smallest unit of analysis is constituted by C&T-goods at the two-digit level, which are traded both domestically and internationally. We adopt a systemic perspective in our study and to account for the spatial dimension of C&T-trade on a global scale we use a rich country-sample of 40 countries. More precisely, we embed the study of country-specific C&T-trade patterns for our two case study countries into an international setting. This we consider as necessary, since international C&T-trade perceives of a rather integrated structure. We further separate between trade in intermediate demand and final demand C&T-goods which proves beneficial in order to do justice to the increasing global nature of production processes. Our systemic approach mirrors also in the fact that we limit our analysis not to a single economic variable but instead we are interested in two distinct economic variables, namely (1) employment and (2) value added in the C&T-industry. We consider this as a strong point of our approach as it helps to create a more full-fledged picture of the experienced restructuring of both countries’ C&T-trade. In particular, the focus set on employment brings in novel aspects, since this indicator has been neglected to some extent in this type of analysis. This, however, is an unsatisfactory fact, as employment dynamics spurred by restructuring processes should be equally high on the political agenda as changes in value-added generation
. Before we explore country-specific C&T-trade patterns for Italy and Portugal as well as changes therein, we focus on global production of C&T-goods and look at whether it is more concentrated or more dispersed in 2009 compared to 1995. Moreover, we investigate productivity of C&T-workers in different regions around the world and its change between 1995 and 2009. In a next step, we concentrate our analysis to global C&T-trade and Italy’s and Portugal’s role therein. In detail, we figure out (changes in) spatial trade patterns in terms of C&T-value added and C&T-labor directly embodied in international C&T-trade flows. In a final step, we identify another range of similarities and differences between C&T-trade patterns of Italy and Portugal, where some measures applied let us draw inference about the two countries’ C&T-production activities. Aspects addressed include: (1) import penetration of C&T-trade and international outsourcing; (2) specialization patterns with respect to the direct C&T-value-added content and direct C&T-labor intensity of C&T-trade flows; and (3) the distance to final demand for C&T-goods, where we use the economic space for defining proximity. From an analytical viewpoint, we apply the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (Herfindahl 1950; Hirschman 1958) and the coefficient of sectoral variation for exploring concentration patterns of C&T-production on a global scale. In a further step, we choose a network-based approach since this allows us investigating the interdependent structure of global trade in C&T-goods. Our analytical starting point are two C&T-trade networks (TNs) one for C&T-value added and the other one for C&T-labor directly embodied in domestic and international C&T-trade flows. We build our networks based on the graph theoretical concept of an edge-weighted directed graph. The main data source for deriving our C&T-TNs are two world input–output tables (WIOTs)—one for 1995 and one for 2009, which we take from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) (Timmer et al. 2015). Since we trace multiple aspects of restructuring of C&T-trade and embed the analysis for our two case study countries into an international setting, we contribute to a better understanding of the nature of restructuring of trade in a single commodity—C&T-goods—as triggered by changes in the institutional and technological environment. Moreover, the study of both similarities and differences between restructuring of Italian and Portuguese C&T-trade proves decisive for effective policy design. The paper proceeds as follows. We start with a discussion on the methods and an explanation of data handling and related preparatory work in Sect. 2. Section 3 reports empirical results, and Sect. 4 concludes.",6

At increasing competitive conditions, it is important to measure or assess the efficiency in order to answer the questions such as “How much should a production using limited resources be?” and “How limited resources should be used?” Adapting manufacturing units to these unstable and variable conditions in today’s world firstly has considered the competition in terms of efficiency, and then, it has supported the continuation and its related patterns in the macrobalance of the country. Among the methods of increasing production, development of production factors and creating remarkable changes in developing countries’ technology are faced with a lot of problems and limitations. Therefore, technical efficiency increase has been mentioned as a better and more adequate solution. Technical efficiency increase can make more production by a fixed set of production factors, and it is of particular importance because of preventing resources from being wasted. In industrial sectors, this issue is of fundamental interest to managers. Using data from 2006, in this article, it has tried to analyze the efficiency of Turkey manufacturing industry. The most important particular of this article is the study of technical efficiency of manufacturing industries both by sector and for all and also is unveil of how using and evaluating of production factors (labor and capital) in this sector. In addition, due to differences in industrial scale, studying the relationship between technical efficiency and size of production units is important which was examined with technological gap ratio (TGR) approach. In the first section of the study, the importance and position of the Turkey manufacturing industry will be discussed, and it describes subsectors operating in this sector. In the second step, the conceptual and theoretical framework of efficiency and generally theoretical framework of the study will be discussed.

Historically, all electricity related services in Japan have been overseen by regional monopolistic entities. After the reform is completed, both the wholesale and retail electricity markets will be perfectly competitive, as in most countries in the EU, and many states in the USA and Australia (METI 2015). For the most part, the wholesale electricity market in Japan has already been liberalized, whereas only high-voltage power in the retail electricity market has been liberalized. During the next several years, the scope of retail electricity liberalization is expected to expand to small-scale factories and households. The liberalization of retail electricity is attracting considerable attention because of decreasing retail electricity prices and increasing electricity serving services. However, there are also some concerns that electricity system reform will increase peak-time electricity prices and corresponding tariffs as early electricity-liberalized countries.Footnote 1 Famously, the UK electricity market saw retail electricity prices double after liberalization. Should such price increases occur in Japan, they would become a heavy burden for small-scale factories and households. Our research question is straightforward. Could electricity system reform in Japan improve social welfare while reducing the cost of retail electricity? Even if improvement could be achieved, would this not be the result of someone’s sacrifice? In the economic literature, although there are various studies on the efficiency and design of the wholesale electricity market, there is little analytical research on the role of electricity retailers and the effects of retail electricity liberalization.Footnote 2 As far as we know, the only study on this area is Joskow and Tirole (2006). Joskow and Tirole (2006) examined the performances of the competitive real-time retail market given metering technology and consumer price responsiveness and showed that liberalization without the introduction of smart meters sometimes decreases the effectiveness of retail electricity trading. We applied their economic model to express electricity trading after the electricity system reform in Japan, but the aim of our study is quite different. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we develop an economic model for a simple but complete electricity system. We use a full electricity related economic model, and thus this paper differs from most analytical studies on electricity trading that only focus on electricity related activities and omit many important properties for ease of analysis. Next, we characterize both the default and post-reform electricity systems in Japan. By comparing the performances of the two systems, we evaluate the impact of electricity system reform on social welfare, retail service efforts and retail electricity prices. We show that after the electricity system reform the peak-time retail electricity price could be higher, equal to or even lower than the default price. Including the case where system reform results in an electricity price drop, we show three cases where electricity system reform does not negatively impact small-scale factories and households. In concluding section, we summarize our findings.",

Hence, six countries have been taken as sample for this research: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. The World Bank has conducted Enterprise Surveys on many countries using firm-level data of a representative sample of economy’s private sectors. What we are closely examining are the effects of foreign direct investments on the development of domestic firms and the overall economy. Indeed, foreign direct investments remain main concern as major source of capital directed toward enterprise restructuring. Using data of Southeast Europe will be scrutinized the interrelationships between output and set of variables that influence the FDI patterns. Further, we are interested in the way foreign direct investments shape the economy. The basic hypothesis is that output depends on set of variables and is possibly driven by foreign ownership influx. In order to test this hypothesis, it is used standard growth accounting approach, i.e., Cobb–Douglas production function, and more specifically two different ways are employed to see the effects. The first path is a regression used to see outcomes for every specific country separately. On the other hand, the second course of research examines the relationship of output to set of variables for the whole region of Southeast Europe. The academic significance of the topic is in determining the factors that influence foreign direct investments, as well as the way FDI spillovers contribute toward the development of Southeast Europe transition economies. In Sects. 2 and 3, we give the theoretical and literature framework and possible impact on the growth of the host country. Further, in Sect. 4 we form the analytical framework comprised of two main elements: (a) sample selection and data and (b) model and econometrics. Section 5 encompasses the results and effects, where we give simulations and answers to the research question. Finally, Sect. 5 tries to raise certain academic discussions and concludes.",12

Such policy is also important for developing countries to promote and sustain economic growth. While growing interest in innovation policies has recently emerged, little attention has been paid to complementarity among heterogeneous technologies.Footnote 1 According to Rosenberg (1982), the complementarity constitutes a major characteristic of technological change. This implies that sufficient attention should be paid to the inter-sectoral spillover effects of innovation in implementing innovation policies. Indeed, according to Hirschman (1958), the lack of inter-dependence and linkage among various industries is a typical characteristic of underdeveloped economies. Economic development and growth inevitably accompany the evolution of intensified inter-sectoral relations. Because technological change plays a critical role in this process, as suggested by the endogenous growth literature (see, for example, Grossman and Helpman 1991; Aghion and Howitt 1998); a sector’s technological inter-dependence must be properly understood to implement development and growth policies that promote innovation. While several studies measure inter-sectoral spillover effects in a few specific industries (see, for example, Bernstein and Nadiri 1988; Jaffe 1989; Jaffe et al. 1993), there is little empirical research that comprehensively evaluates inter-sectoral (technological) spillover effects within a country or region. Coe and Helpman (1995) and Badinger and Egger (2008) estimated international research and development (R&D) spillovers in a sample of countries associated with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),Footnote 2 but their R&D spillover measures were aggregated into a few variables so that more specific inter-sectoral spillover effects were not revealed. Dietzenbacher (2000) conducted one of the few empirical studies that analyzes technological spillover effects by disentangling them into product and process innovations under an input–output framework.Footnote 3 However, the model assumes a standard Leontief economy, and the paper evaluates the overall spillover effects of each sector.Footnote 4 This approach means that the spillover effects between two sectors could not be recovered.Footnote 5 Similarly, while both Bos et al. (2014) and Wolff and Nadiri (1993) share a similar research interest with that of the present paper, their empirical analyses were more concerned with overall spillover effects and made no attempt to reveal inter-sectoral spillover effects in innovation. The purpose of this paper is first to provide the micro-foundation for a new empirical framework that evaluates the properties of innovation linkages among manufacturing sectors under a multi-sector general equilibrium framework. “Innovation linkages” refer to the effect of sector-specific innovations on productivity growth within an economy or region. For example, an increase in productivity in the ith sector affects productivity growth in other sectors, which in turn exerts some influence on the original sector. These mutual inter-dependences are termed “innovation linkages” in this paper. Although we could start our empirical evaluation from the innovation version of the input–output matrix (innovation input–output matrix, hereafter) without specifying the underlying theoretical model, this would conceal its implicit assumptions. Therefore, to lay down the micro-foundation of the matrix, we first develop the general equilibrium model behind the matrix. After deriving this matrix, we estimate innovation linkages in East Asian countries and draw implications for growth strategies in the East Asian region and in the USA. In particular, we are interested in measuring innovation backward and forward linkages. The concepts of backward and forward linkages were originally proposed by Hirschman (1958). Backward linkages refer to the stimuli going to sectors that supply the inputs required by a particular activity, whereas forward linkages are the inducements to set up new activities that utilize the output of the proposed activity. If these linkage effects are sufficiently strong, underdeveloped countries are more likely to recover from poverty. A number of empirical studies have been conducted to measure the linkage effects based on input–output matrices and to identify key sectors (Chenery and Watanabe 1958; Rasmussen 1956; Schultz 1977; Dietzenbacher and van der Linden 1997; Miller and Lahr 2001). However, these inter-sectoral linkages are concerned with commodity transactions, which differ from innovation linkages. This paper defines “innovation backward linkages” of the ith sector as the increase in productivity growth in this sector that results from productivity growth in other sectors. “Innovation forward linkages” refer to the effect of productivity growth in this sector on productivity growth in other sectors.Footnote 6 In other words, the former regards the sector as a user of innovation and measures the magnitude of benefits received from inter-sectoral spillover effects. The latter regards the sector as a supplier of innovation and measures its contribution to productivity growth in other sectors. These linkage effects can be evaluated using an innovation input–output matrix in which inter-sectoral spillover effects in innovation are described.Footnote 7
 The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for deriving and constructing the innovation input–output matrix, which must be differentiated from the technology and commodity input–output matrices. Second, based on the former matrix, we conduct an empirical analysis of innovation backward and forward linkages and test policy effectiveness in our data. This paper distinguishes itself from the existing literature in this field by proposing a new innovation input–output matrix. In the empirical section of this paper, the properties of innovation linkages are examined from the following two perspectives. First, we test whether a (regional) balanced growth policy is more conducive to the promotion of innovation than a (regional) unbalanced one. Note that the balanced growth policy tries to promote innovation in all sectors equally, while the unbalanced policy primarily supports innovation in selected sectors (Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Hirschman 1958; Streeten 1959; Murphy et al. 1989). If the balanced growth policy is innovation promoting, then a uniform, balanced growth policy should be implemented. Otherwise, a sector-specific, unbalanced growth policy should be pursued. The indicator used for this test is the difference in innovation forward linkages across sectors. The outcome of our empirical examination indicates that policy should favor unbalanced growth over a balanced growth. Second, after the unbalanced growth strategy is selected, the specific targets of the growth strategy should be identified. We identify targets in terms of “core” and “bottleneck” sectors. Core sectors refer to high-growth sectors that have high innovation forward linkages, while bottleneck sectors are low-growth sectors that have high innovation backward linkages. The unbalanced growth strategy should promote innovation in core and bottleneck sectors, and these sectors can be identified only through measuring innovation linkages. We constructed the innovation input–output matrix using industry-level TFP data for Japan, Korea, China, and the USA and examined the properties of the innovation linkages in these countries. Japan, Korea, and China are included as they represent East Asian countries that have experienced high economic growth and development in the past. Moreover, the three economies have close ties, with official negotiations on a trilateral free trade pact having recently been attempted. Indeed, it is predicted that Japan, Korea, and China will soon form an integral economic region (see, for example, Wong 2006). In addition, these countries have established strong economic relations with the USA beyond their regional boundaries. It is therefore critical to examine the underlying innovation relations not only in the East Asian region, but also in the integrated region of East Asia and the USA and to ascertain the difference between the two. Innovation promoting multi-regional growth strategies can be derived from the estimates of an innovation input–output matrix in a target region. If the target differs, the corresponding innovation input–output matrix and innovation linkages also differ, leading to different growth strategies. Hence, it should be noted that the empirical analysis in this paper is conducted using the pooled samples of the two regions selected for the study. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 develops a basic theoretical model that provides a framework for the following empirical studies. Section 3 empirically estimates innovation input–output matrices and innovation linkages and derives policy implications. Finally, Sect. 4 presents conclusions.",

Global current account imbalance is also rising with the USA and other major developed economies running a persistent current account deficit against some emerging market countries with big surpluses. Notably, the 2007 US current account deficit has enlarged to 6 % from 2.4 % in 1998. Alike, the Eurozone current account deficit has widened over 4 % of GDP in 2008. This unexpected rise in current account deficit beyond historical standard has received a substantial attention in recent year. On contrary, China and other Asian Tigers (South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand) are running current account surplus on an average 6.4 % of GDP in 2000–2009 which put forward them to one of the world’s largest lender. In spite of having rapid growth and enormous domestic investment opportunities, these economies have increasingly been outflowing a major portion of their savings to foreign countries. Additionally, other emerging economies including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Middle Eastern oil exporters also are increasing their potentiality toward current account surpluses since 1990s. Thus, many (Bernanke 2005; Prasad et al. 2007; Carroll and Jeanne 2009; Buera and Shin 2009; Aguiar and Amador 2011; Miller et al. 2011) observe that superfluous savings is uphilling from capital-scarce emerging and developing economies to the capital-abundant developed countries during the last two decades. This observed counterintuitive phenomenon widely revealed as ‘Lucas Paradox.’Footnote 1
 Many alternative theoretical models (Bussière et al. 2004; Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995b; Caballero et al. 2008; Edwards 1996; Gourinchas and Jeanne 2013) have given diverse forecast of the underlying determinants of current account imbalances. Some empirical studies (Debelle and Faruqee 1996; Chinn and Prasad 2003; Chinn and Ito 2007; Lee et al. 2008) have tested these theoretical framework, either directly or indirectly to examine the determinants of current account balance. Since, most of the studies consider only developed and some emerging economies, which limit to capture the actual impact of potential current account determinants. Given this background, it is essential to find out the significant determinants using advanced technique and large sample which is rarely portrayed either in theory or in empirical investigation. Thus, the determinants of global current account imbalance remain ambiguous in theoretical and empirical discussion. Hence, this research contributes a broad empirical characterization to analyze the determinants of global current account imbalances covering a large heterogeneous group of 106 countries under dynamic panel GMM framework. The main reference comes from few empirical papers (Glick and Rogoff 1995; Calderon et al. 2002; Chinn and Prasad 2003; Gruber and Kamin 2007; Chinn and Ito 2007) on the determinants of current account balance from which this article borrow the baseline information. Except others’ this study improves this work in two way, first, use commodity price index, de jure classification of capital openness and exchange rate stability index along with other commonly used determinants (e.g., net foreign assets, real effective exchange rate, real GDP growth and trade openness), which better captures the determinants of global current account imbalances. Second, employ the difference and system GMM estimation in a strongly balanced panel framework of 106 sample countries (among them 27 developed, 32 emerging and 47 developing economies) using enriched data from various sources over the time period 1980–2011. It is essential to emphasize at this point that this paper does not intent to revisit the previous finding in the current or capital account literatures. Instead, it draws on those finding only to obtain a reasonable set of additional explanatory and control variables along with commonly used determinants in the literature to find the determinants of global current account imbalances. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out the empirical motivation. Section 3 contains a discussion of some theoretical and empirical literature. Section 4 describes data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents estimation techniques. Section 6 describes the results, while Sect. 7 details the results of selected robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 8 offers conclusion and direction for future research.",16

Without knowing how industries are interconnected with one another, no one should be able to grasp how an environmental restriction imposed on an industry affects other industries directly or indirectly and what the final result would be. A waste problem is no exception. A requirement for reduction of waste generated from an end-of-life product (ELP) should affect not only the industry which produces that product but also other industries indirectly. When it comes to a waste problem, however, there is a peculiar feature on an interactive aspect between industries, interaction between environmentally friendly producers and environmentally friendly waste-disposal firms out of a market boundary. It is often found that producers and waste-disposal firms are interactively or cooperatively working, in a certain institutional environment, for waste reduction as well as prevention of pollution which might be accompanied with waste treatment. Such an interactive nature has attracted a great deal of attention, since it is considered to promote the so-called design for environment (DfE) and contribute to controlling the flow of environmental burdens at the production stage. Yet, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this problem has not been dealt with satisfaction by researchers so far. The purpose of this paper is to address this problem by means of a Sraffian type of inter-industrial reproduction model based upon Sraffa (1960), which is supposed to be most suitable to the analysis of the problem.Footnote 1 By so doing, I demonstrate how environmentally friendly production and waste disposal are successfully implemented in an economy and, in this sense, how a sustainable economy is realized. It will be shown that such implementation can be interpreted as an application of extended producer responsibility (EPR), which is proposed by OECD. Although problems of waste disposal or recycling have not been taken up by Sraffian economists until quite recently, rudimentary works can be found in the rather early stages of the research. Steedman (1975, 1977) shows that negative value plays a crucial role in the analysis of positive profits with negative surplus value. Certainly, he does not explicitly deal with waste problems in his works, but his anatomy of negative value potentially has the seed of the study of waste problems: The idea of negative value can naturally be developed to that of negative prices, and those prices can be interpreted as a scarcity index of bads or dis-commodities. Franke’s work (1986) shows that negative prices cannot be avoided in a joint production model, when a free-disposal assumption is abandoned so that bads or dis-commodities are taken into account. It may be said that his work is a starting point of the analysis of waste problems by means of a Sraffa model, although it is so general that concrete issues on waste treatment are not discussed explicitly. 
Fujimoto and Opocher (2010), Lager (2001) and Hosoda (2010b) are more explicit in dealing with bads or dis-commodities in a Sarrafian type of model. Taking residuals discharged from economic activities into account and discarding a free-disposal assumption, they demonstrate how a capitalist economy can reproduce itself in the long run. Clearly, a costly disposal process, whether it is a waste-disposal process or a recycling process, is crucial for the reproducibility of an economy. Although those works have contributed to the development of the Sraffian analysis toward exploration of relationships between an economy and environment, they more or less remain at an abstract level, having a distance from applicability to real environmental policies. Circumstances have, however, changed gradually. Hosoda (2010a) utilizes a Sraffian type of model to demonstrate the necessity of EPR, which is an effective waste management policy and has been adopted in many countries. He also applies the model to a realistic situation in which a secondary material obtained by recycling is degraded, demonstrating that the conventional Sraffian model can be naturally extended to the one which describes the transaction of commodities and bads or dis-commodities in a modern recycling society (Hosoda 2012, 2014).Footnote 2
 The present work is situated in a natural extension of the research line of the above studies and shares the basic structure and characteristics with them. I would like, however, to emphasize that there is a big difference between the present work and the previous ones: The important feature that production processes and waste-disposal processes are interconnected through the effects which are given outside market transactions is fully taken into account and analyzed. Environmentally friendly production, represented by, say, DfE may possibly ease difficulties often accompanied by waste disposal, reducing the disposal costs. On the other hand, environmentally friendly disposal of waste may possibly help production processes become more environmentally friendly by releasing the information on proper treatment of waste, which can improve production processes in a more environmentally friendly way. These are the things which are happening in an actual economy and the points which I would like to emphasize and analyze in this paper. The structure of this paper is as follows: The next section displays the fundamental settings of the paper. A rough sketch of an economy is given as well as the basic assumptions and structure of the model, to facilitate the understanding of the general thrust of the paper. In the third section, some fundamental mathematical deductions and main propositions are demonstrated. In the final section, concluding remarks are made.",2

As is well known, these two options theoretically give identical carbon emission distribution. However, in reality, carbon tax has hardly been accepted by industries while emission certificate as a part of cap-and-trade system such as EU-ETS has been implemented in some limited regions. The realization of these carbon emission control policies is still far from the “covering all commodities and regions” stage. When carbon control policy is implemented in the limited countries, so-called carbon leakage phenomenon arises where high carbon intensity industries move to those countries where no carbon policy exists and import the products. According to the current measurement scheme of carbon emission based on the primary energy consumption based, or upstream based, “exporting firms and importing products” strategy is natural, but this strategy could increase the global GHG emission since energy efficiency in developing regions tends to be lower than in developed countries. Demand-side-based emission assessment has been proposed by embodying the energy consumption into the tradable commodities in order to avoid the above loophole.
 The basic formulation to embody the emission in the commodity is as follows: according to the standard input–output framework, domestic production relationships are represented by where A, x and f denote input–output coefficient matrix, production vector and final demand vector, respectively. Introducing c as the direct GHG emission coefficient vector of each sector, total GHG emission is represented by where GHG emission is distributed among final demand sectors. The above procedure can easily be expanded to the bilateral trade by decomposing the final demand vector f into domestic final demand and international trade. When we deal with the multiregional global trade market where a certain commodity could be imported from multiple regions with different technologies and energy sources, more complex method is needed. Peters and Hertwich (2008) proposed the procedure to embody the energy consumptions in the international trade based on the multiregional input–output tables (MRIO). Then, they define the consumption-based emission inventory as the total emissions occurring from economic consumption within a country r as follows: where \(f_{r}^{\text{cons}} , f_{r}^{\text{prod}} , f_{r}^{e} ,f_{r}^{m}\) and \(f_{r}^{\text{BEET}}\) represent the total consumption-based emission, emission caused by the domestic production, total export to other regions, total import from other regions and balance of emissions embodied in trade, respectively. Liu et al. (2010) expanded the above approach by applying the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to see the dynamic structural changes in China. Tang et al. (2013) also estimate the international trade of UK applying the embodied energy analysis from the view of national energy security. It should be noted that the above method based on the input–output analysis focuses on the allocation of fossil fuel consumption among commodities. The emissions and the technological improvement on energy efficiency of the energy conversion sectors, such as power generation sector and petroleum products industry, are not explicitly dealt with. Furthermore, when we consider the distribution of the emission allocation and the evaluation of the efforts to reduce the GHG emissions, more concrete evaluation procedure is needed. The effects of the partial participation in the GHG control scheme in the different accounting method will then appear.",
5.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,09 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-016-0035-x,Matching global cobalt demand under different scenarios for co-production and mining attractiveness,December 2016,Alexandre Tisserant,Stefan Pauliuk,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Almost all elements of the periodic table are used in modern technology, especially for renewable energy and communication technologies. Graedel et al. assessed the performance of potential substitutes for all major applications of the different elements (Greenfield and Graedel 2013). Their central finding is that no element can be completely replaced by others, making each element a unique and important contributor to modern technology. These specialty metals may face supply constraints in the future, not just because of limited mineral resources, but also because of mismatch between demand and available production capacity (Gerling et al. 2004). Moreover, they may be subject to trade restrictions due to export limitations imposed by individual countries. As resources are getting depleted and ore grades decline, the costs of extracting a mineral will increase, though future scarcity is often not reflected in commodity prices at present (Prior et al. 2012). Regional resource scarcity, regional production capacity, regional policies, and international political relations strongly influence future availability and trade patterns for critical materials (European Commission 2010). To anticipate possible future development, one needs prospective assessment of the anthropogenic cycles of specialty metals (Pauliuk and Hertwich 2015), without attempting to predict the future. A scenario analysis of future supply of critical metals is a more modest and scientific approach than a prediction; it enables researchers and policy makers to study the consequences of future economic development on metal reserves and possible futures and supply shortages in different regions. Such a scenario analysis could provide the basis for dynamic assessment of material criticality, as proposed by (Roelich et al. 2014; Knoeri et al. 2013), by applying the criticality framework developed by (Graedel et al. 2012; Nuss et al. 2014) in a prospective model. Estimating the time when current mineral resources will be depleted requires a scenario analysis of metal demand on the global scale and with a long-term perspective. While new for critical metals, this type of analysis is commonly applied to bulk materials including steel, cement, and aluminum. Some integrated assessment models (IAM), for example, consider energy-relevant bulk materials like steel and cement, but not critical materials. This can be seen from the 5th AR of the IPCC, where scenarios for GHG emissions from material production generated by IAMs are presented, but criticality aspects are not quantified (IPCC 2014). Dynamic stock modeling and material flow analysis (MFA) can be combined to produce prospective studies of future global demand for bulk materials. It has been applied to steel (Hatayama et al. 2010; Pauliuk et al. 2013) and aluminum (Liu et al. 2012). The approach was refined to allow for the study of critical materials (Busch et al. 2014), but it has not yet been applied to potentially critical metals on the global scale. For specific sectors, especially electricity generation from renewable sources, prospective studies for total metal demand exist for silver, gallium, germanium, selenium, indium, tellurium, neodymium, and dysprosium (Zuser and Rechberger 2011; Elshkaki and Graedel 2013, 2014; Roelich et al. 2014; Løvik et al. 2015). These studies found potential supply shortages in different deployment scenarios for silver, tellurium, indium, and germanium. Interconnections between host and by-product metals are increasingly recognized as a main component of criticality (Graedel et al. 2012; Frenzel et al. 2015; Peiró et al. 2013; Mudd et al. 2013b; Graedel and Reck 2015; Løvik et al. 2015). The previously mentioned MFA studies focused on quantifying flows of critical metals and potential imbalances between co-products of mining, but are lacking a clear link to models of total available resources and mining capacity. We believe that this link is of particular interest for critical metals, which are mainly extracted as by-product, because their future supply might still be bound to the mining developments of the host metal(s). Of particular concern are situations where new deposits enter production for their respective main metals, which contain no or insignificant amounts of the critical metal of interest. Multiregional input–output analysis (MRIO) contains comprehensive information on international trade and it can be used to trace materials through the global supply chain, both in demand-driven (critical material footprint of final demand) and supply-driven models (distribution of critical materials across final products). Examples for the former include the study of neodymium, cobalt, and platinum footprint of Japanese households (Shigetomi et al. 2015) and for the latter they include the approach by Moran et al. (2014), who use a supply-driven model to trace a conflict mineral through the world economy. MRIO is suitable for making demand scenario analyses, because it contains ‘recipes’ based on coefficients denoting the amount of input required by unit of demand. From this information, product-specific demand scenarios and critical metal intensity of production scenarios can be created. The location and type of future mines of host metals will determine the supply of critical metals that are not mined as main product, because a new project for extraction of the host metal does not necessarily provide enough quantities of the companion metals to help match demand. Factors that can influence the choice of where to expand capacities include ore grades, available infrastructure, environmental issues, relations with the local communities, political and social stability (Mudd et al. 2013b; Prior et al. 2012). These factors can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) the mineralogy of the deposit, which determines the grades, the recovery rate of by-product, and environmental issues. Cobalt recovery rates from by-products of copper and nickel mining can vary from 25 to 80 % depending mostly on the type of deposit, while at the same time, potential mines where cobalt could be recovered as main product would rely on arsenic-rich ores and that would have to be managed carefully (Mudd et al. 2013b). (2) The location and surroundings of the deposit which include the accessibility, land ownership rights, and political stability. For cobalt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been the main supplier but its instability is known to have influenced cobalt price (Seddon 2001), and electricity shortages are known to influence the amount of cobalt refined in Congo (USGS 2014). Future production of fossil fuels is usually modeled using ‘ultimately recoverable resources’ models, and a similar methodology has recently been applied to copper (Northey et al. 2014). The model by Northey et al. only takes into account the ore grade when deciding where to install new mining capacity. We believe that the attractiveness of the deposit location should also be taken into account. The Fraser Institute yearly publishes a survey of mining companies from which the Investment Attractiveness Index (IAI) is derived, which can be used to rank countries and jurisdictions. It has two components: (1) the Policy Perception Index that looks at policy factors influencing investments and (2) the Best Practices Mineral Potential Index that rates the pure attractiveness of the jurisdiction’s geology (Cervantes et al. 2014). There is a lack of prospective modeling tools to estimate future global demand for critical materials in different regions. Models to indicate how fast known resources may be depleted in different regions are available but the investment attractiveness of different regions has not been taken into account. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of IO-based techniques for quantifying the future flows of critical metals, and to combine IO with dynamic stock models to make it respect physical boundaries that are absent in standard Leontief IO modeling. We show how a static MRIO table can be used to estimate future critical material demand and develop an optimization routine to determine the location of new mines under geological and policy constrains. This paper focuses on the global demand for and supply of cobalt, a potentially critical metal mainly used in high performance alloys but also in lithium-ion batteries and catalysts. A hybrid MRIO model based on the EXIOBASE v2.2.0 multiregional supply and use table was built to estimate cobalt demand in different regions (Wood et al. 2014). Extraction of cobalt can happen in several regions of the world. To match supply and demand for cobalt, we apply an optimization routine that determines in which regions and in which mine types resources are extracted and where new mining capacity will be installed. To do justice to the by-product nature of cobalt (Co) that is extracted from copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) ore, we consider seven type of resources: one for each combinations of the three metals that can be present in a deposit at the same time (Co, Cu, Ni, Co–Cu, Co–Ni, Cu–Ni and Co–Cu–Ni). This optimization model determines where the mining of cobalt is more likely to happen by considering regional mining capacity by mine and the IAI from the Fraser Institute to model mining risk. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 introduces the model approach and the data used. Sect. 3 presents the results for several scenarios. Sect. 4 discusses the findings and the model and Sect. 5 concludes.",55

At the production firm level, the benefits of energy efficiency include reduction in resource use, improved production and capacity utilization, and less operation and maintenance costs, which lead to improved productivity and competitiveness (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2013; Ryan and Campbell 2012; Worrell et al. 2003). Indeed, improvements in energy efficiency in manufacturing plants lead to reduced demand for energy and hence releasing the excess demand to other potential users (Ryan and Campbell 2012). The excess energy demand especially at peak time of use zones attracts maximum demand charges from utilities (Schneider Electric 2008), in a two- or three-part tariff structure, which includes energy and demand components. Electricity shortages are common in many countries in Sub Saharan Africa (Eberhard and Shkaratan 2012; Eberhard et al. 2008). More recently, in 2006, Uganda experienced a deficit in electricity supply owing to a prolonged drought, delayed development of the 250 MW Bujagali hydropower project, and demand growth (Mawejje et al. 2013; Heffner et al. 2010). Consequently, between 2007 and 2011, the Uganda Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) with support from the World Bank conducted targeted energy audit studies of large manufacturing plants with the highest potential to save electricity (World Bank 2012). These studies evaluated the costs required to implement the energy conservation measures with a special focus on the efficient use of electricity. Results from the energy audit studies in Uganda showed that most of the large industries in the country were energy inefficient, with the power factor ranging between 0.52 and 0.85 (see Fig 4 in Appendix); yet Uganda’s Electricity (Primary Grid Code) Regulations, 2003, require that the power factor for electricity distributors and big consumers should not fall below 0.9. This is because the power factor, which is defined as the ratio of ‘active or productive power’ (measured in kilowatts—kW) used in the circuit to the ‘reactive or apparent power’ (expressed in kilo-volt amperes—kVA) is the percentage of electricity that is used to do useful work in electrical equipment (Bhatia 2012). Therefore, the lower the ratio of active to reactive power, the higher the wastage of the energy resource. All consumers of electricity including domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers contribute to peak demand, though at different magnitudes depending on the rating and efficiency of their electrical appliances. One of the findings from the electricity energy audit studies was that energy efficiency in large industries in Uganda could be attained by installation of power factor correction (PFC) equipment such as capacitor banks. Such power factor correction equipment could be installed as distributed PFC, group PFC, centralized PFC, combined PFC or automatic PFC depending on the underlying causes of the low-power factor in the electrical system. Extensive discussions on power factor correction are provided in ABB (2010). In an effort to stem the inefficient use of the scarce electricity resource, in 2009, the government of Uganda received funding from the World Bank under the second phase of the Rural Energy Transformation Project (ERT-2) to implement various energy efficiency interventions including the initiative to improve the power factor and hence save energy and associated costs for industrial and commercial electricity consumers—with maximum demand greater than 100 kVA (Mukherji 2014). The ERT-2 project focusing on the power factor improvement scheme is implemented by the Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU) under the Business Uganda Development Scheme (BUDS). The target power to be saved under this initiative is 10.4 Mega-Volt Amperes (MVA) of demand and associated wasted energy. According PSFU-BUDS, however, as of the third quarter of 2014, up to 21 manufacturing companies (see Fig. 4 in Appendix) had benefited from the scheme leading to a total saving of 8.04 MVA of demand equivalent to 8.4 MW of electricity. Much as the ERT-2 project was approved in 2009, actual implementation of the power factor improvement scheme started in 2011 but in a slow pace. Implementation of this component gained pace by late 2012 and up to 80 % of the realized savings of 8.04 MVA of demand have been achieved between 2013 and 2014. Comparing the targeted MVA savings vis-à-vis the actual, to-date, the project has achieved up to 77 % of the target 10.4 MVA of demand. However, since ERT-2 project is planned to close on 30th June 2016, PSFU-BUDS officials are optimistic that the power factor improvement scheme of ERT-2 project will achieve 100 % or more of targeted saving of demand. Energy saving initiatives such as the power factor improvement scheme of ERT-2 project contribute significantly in mitigating and stabilizing peak or maximum demand of electrical network resources (Schneider Electric 2008). In countries such as Uganda where electricity supply barely meets the system demand requirements, policymakers, regulators, system operators as well as distribution network operators are always wary of any likely surge in the maximum demand that may propagate system outages and hence jeopardize the quality of electricity supply. For that reason, any initiatives implemented to improve the energy use efficiency of large consumers of electricity who customarily exert maximum demand on the system, are a welcome relief to the stakeholders in the electricity supply industry. Much as power factor improvement schemes may be expedient relievers of maximum demand, their attendant impacts on peak demand in general and in Uganda in particular have received little attention. Studies elsewhere have examined impacts of community behavioral issues (Gyamfi et al. 2013); economic (Oldewurtel et al. 2010; Psiloglou et al. 2009) as well as environmental factors (Barker et al. 2012) on peak electricity demand. A recent study by (Never 2015) investigated the role of behavioral factors for the energy management of enterprises in Uganda. In a related study, Never (2014) examined the role of behavioral factors in improving energy efficiency policies directed toward poor populations. However, as far as we are aware, no empirical study has investigated the impact of power factor correction on electricity peak demand general and in Uganda in particular. Previous studies have focused primarily on the benefits of power factor correction on electricity demand by the companies to which the intervention was directed. A better understanding of these issues will enable public policy to be designed in a direction which improves energy security and efficiency. It is against this background that this study examined the impact of power factor improvement schemes on peak electricity demand. Specifically, the study examined the level of variability of peak demand in the period before and after implementation of power factor improvement schemes and assesses the likely impact of power factor improvement schemes on peak demand. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data and methods of analysis; results and discussions are presented in Section 3; Section 4 concludes the paper.",5

In order to achieve this, first, the outputs and final demands were estimated for each sector and region using actual data. Then, taking into account these estimated figures, the trade and import coefficients of the input–output tables (multiregional tables for the six regions of the prefecture) were modified. Finally, using these new tables, changes in backward-linkage effects were quantified. The Tohoku earthquake took place on March 11, 2011. The greater part of the resulting physical damage occurred within three prefectures of the Tohoku region: Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima (see Fig. 1). In addition to the direct effects of the earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima suffered a consequent nuclear accident. Areas focused on during this study For the first few weeks (or months in some cases) after the disaster, the economic difficulties were largely associated with broken supply chains and logistical constraints. Moreover, even after some temporary reconstruction was undertaken, local industries were still faced with another problem: reduced demand. To characterize the situation in which demand switches from one region to another for geographical, psychological, structural, or other reasons, Yonemoto and Kanno (2012) modified the trade coefficients (intra-prefectural) and import coefficients (inter-prefectural) of multiregional input–output tables and conducted a sensitivity analysis. They made a significant discovery: Because the analysis only used the data released just after the disaster, large changes in the origins of imports were observed in many sectors. In particular, backward-linkage effects were considerably lower in “Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery,” “Manufacturing,” and “Services” within the coastal regions. Yonemoto and Kanno (2012) then used 2011 data and focused on only two coastal regions among the six regions of the Fukushima prefecture. This study updates and extends this earlier study with new data from 2012 and 2013 in order to continue to examine the trend in the 3 years following the disaster. There have been many economic studies undertaken on the effect of natural disasters. Others that have used similar input–output analyses include Cochrane (1974), which predicts losses due to a hypothetical earthquake in the vicinity of San Francisco, and Rose et al. (1997), who study the effect of a hypothetical earthquake occurring close to Memphis. Takahashi et al. (1997) combine an input–output analysis with an econometric model and estimate economic losses due to the Great Hanshin earthquake, an earthquake that occurred in Japan in 1995. Okuyama (2004) further analyzes the same earthquake using a “Sequential Interindustry Model.” Tsuchiya et al. (2005) examine the economic effect of 2004 Chuetsu Earthquake with a Spatial Computable General Equilibrium (SCGE) model and Yamano et al. (2007) attempt the same using a regional grid model. Following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, Chujo et al. (2013) analyzed broken supply chains in the aftermath of the earthquake. Ihara et al. (2013) characterized current economic potentials and then predicted future migration using a spatial framework. Hayashiyama et al. (2014) explored redistributive effects of investment for reconstruction over prefectures. Other studies using input–output analyses, in particular, the Hypothetical Extraction Method (HEM), which modifies the input coefficients or other coefficients in order to characterize the importance of an industry or a region, follow the work of Strassart (1968) and are summarized by Miller and Lahr (2001). Among them is Regional Extraction Model, which was introduced by Dietzenbacher et al. (1993) and extracts a region instead of a sector. Nozaki (2013, 2015) in addition has attempted to characterize the impact of 2011 Tohoku earthquake on other regions as well as those directly affected by the shockwaves. The technique used in this study, along with that of Yonemoto and Kanno (2012), is similar to HEM. In most cases, HEM extracts, based on assumptions but not on actual data, the entire section or region of interest from the economy and then measures its overall significance. However, this study also carefully estimates the changes in trade and import coefficients using actual data and investigates current backward-linkage effects in order to identify the sector or region suffering the greatest hardship.Footnote 1
 As far as the author is concerned, one of the main problems with the research that has been conducted so far regarding the aftermath of 2011 earthquake, particularly that related to Fukushima, is that it focuses very little on the actual condition of the residents or firms located in the region. While some people enjoy the benefits the recent demand for reconstruction, others still require urgent aid or even relocation. This study hopes to precisely characterize the economy in these locations and perform practical analysis using these and other observations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the method of analysis; Sect. 3 summarizes the data used in this study, outlines the pre-disaster economies of the regions on which this study focuses and illustrates the changes in output since the disaster. Section 4 presents the results of these analyses and Sect. 5 concludes.",7

In response to the sustained increase in anthropogenic loads on the global environment, environmental footprint analysis has been used to quantify pressures induced by economic activity (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014). Footprint analysis is used to identify entire product life cycles and the loads associated with consumption. In recent years, the application of footprint analysis has expanded from using environmental indicators to using social indicators within the context of sustainability (Čuček et al. 2012; Alsamawi et al. 2014; Simas et al. 2014). Indeed, the application of a “Footprint Family” (see Galli et al. 2012, 2013; Fang et al. 2014) to develop sustainable and interdisciplinary policy measures that integrate more than one footprint indicator is increasing (Giljum et al. 2011; Ewing et al. 2012; Steen-Olsen et al. 2012). Fang et al. (2014) considered that a shift toward the integration of footprint indicators is likely, as no single indicator can be employed to analyze all anthropogenic loads. For example, Steen-Olsen et al. (2012) quantified carbon, land footprints, and (blue) water footprints in the European Union (EU)-27 nations, which correspond to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use, and water resources, respectively. They concluded that although these footprints are intrinsically different, they are also mutually influential, and that reductions in one suggest a hidden trade-off with the other. The application of multi-criteria decision making in industrial policy is common practice. The European Commission (EC) started promoting the use of multiple footprints to analyze the footprints of products and organizations (EC 2013). Similarly, the 17 sustainable development goals put forward by the United Nations also need to consider multiple criteria and their synergies and trade-offs (Cucurachi and Suh 2015). However, such multi-criteria assessments need to take into account consumer-side loads as well as producer-side loads. Numerous studies have quantified the direct and indirect environmental loads associated with household (i.e., consumer-side) consumption (e.g., Munksgaard and Pedersen 2000; Pachauri and Spreng 2002; Lenzen et al. 2004a; Druckman and Jackson 2009; Druckman et al. 2012; Chitnis et al. 2012; Wiedenhofer et al. 2013; Duarte et al. 2014). Household consumption has been demonstrated to be the greatest contributor to national carbon footprints (Hertwich and Peters 2009; Hertwich 2011). In order to analyze differences in the lifestyles of households, many studies have focused on socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as household income and age of the householder (Webber and Matthews 2008; Druckman and Jackson 2009; Kronenberg 2009; Girod and de Haan 2010; Jones and Kammen 2011; Saunders 2013; Chitnis et al. 2014; Shigetomi et al. 2014, 2015). However, except for studies that have specifically applied GHG emissions and energy consumption as multi-criteria, relatively few studies have addressed multiple household loads to date (Nansai et al. 2007; Hubacek et al. 2009; Kerkhof et al. 2009; Reynolds et al. 2015). For example, Reynolds et al. (2015) analyzed carbon, energy, water, and waste footprints associated with weekly food consumption in Australian households. In order to obtain a more complete picture of environmental loads instigated by household consumption, the use of metal resources needs to be quantified in conjunction with GHG emissions, as some metals play a key role in new energy technologies, such as in electric cars and fuel cells. Among these metals are the so-called “critical metals,” which are subject to supply constraints (National Research Council 2008; EC 2010). Neodymium is a rare earth metal that is primarily used to produce the permanent magnets in electric motors. Cobalt is commonly used to produce the positive electrodes in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, and in the superalloys used in aerospace and other engineering applications. Platinum is used in the manufacture of catalytic converters in vehicle exhaust pipes and in applications in the electronics industry. However, no studies have examined the similarities and differences between the carbon and material footprints for these critical metals (material footprints represent both direct and indirect material requirements of final demand). Indeed, although improvements in resource efficiency have been proposed in some states, such as the dematerialization policy described in The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC 2011), few studies have precisely examined the material footprints for minerals in individual nations (Giljum et al. 2015; Wiedmann et al. 2015). Against this background, this study simultaneously analyzed the carbon and material footprints for the three critical metals (neodymium, cobalt, and platinum) in Japanese households with different income levels. In addition, the policy implications of the trade-offs between GHG mitigation and critical metal consumption are considered within the context of these differences in income.",12

Concrete waste and asphalt concrete waste, which are non-metallic mineral wastes, are categorized as industrial wastes in Japan. According to the annual report of Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (2015), the emission of these non-metallic mineral wastes in 2012 was 56.7 million tons in the country, which accounted for 15% of the 379.1 million tons of total industrial waste. There are two emission sources of non-metallic mineral wastes: waste derived from demolishing existing stock, such as structures, and that generated as byproducts of industrial production. Specifically, concrete waste and asphalt generated from demolishing structures and repairing roads, respectively, are non-metallic mineral wastes derived from the demolition of existing stock. On the other hand, iron and steel slag and coal ash, derived from the steel industry and coal-fired power generation, respectively, are non-metallic mineral wastes generated as byproducts of production. On the supply side, considering the generation of non-metallic mineral wastes in the future in Japan, it is expected that concrete waste will continuously and drastically increase. In Japan, the stock of structures had been rapidly accumulated since the 1950s in accordance with high economic growth. Especially, the stock of non-timber structures, which is the main generation source of concrete waste, continued to increase at a higher ratio than that of timber structures every year, and the increasing trend was sustained until the 1990s (see e.g. Ministry of the Environment 2002). The demolition of structures that have reached the end of their life has already begun to increase and is expected to accelerate in the future. Furthermore, because it is hard to imagine that steel production and coal-fired power generation will suddenly decrease, it is expected that the emission of non-metallic mineral wastes will continue to increase. Hashimoto et al. (2009), for example, estimated the stock of materials accumulated as structures in Japan and noted that 32 billion tons of materials were accumulated as construction commodities in 2000, of which 9 billion tons are likely to be generated as waste in the future. On the other hand, on the demand side, recycled non-metallic mineral wastes are primarily used in civil engineering and construction, such as base course and raw cement materials. The demand has begun to decrease due to the saturation of social infrastructures. This phenomenon leads to the collapse of the balance of supply and demand in non-metallic mineral wastes, which increases the amount of final disposal. While this phenomenon has already been detected in Japan, there is a high possibility that other Asian countries, which have achieved high economic growth, will also face a similar one in the future. It is crucial to establish appropriate waste management policies, particularly focusing on non-metallic mineral wastes, for sustainable development in the Asia–Pacific region. Therefore, it is significant to select Japan as the case study of non-metallic mineral wastes, because it provides useful implications for future waste policies in Asian countries. Furthermore, it is also significant that this paper, which targets the case study of Japan, is published as the Special Issue on “On the Nexus of Economy and Environment in the Asia–Pacific Region.” Based on the circumstances described above, this paper, considering the case of Japan, investigates the material flow resulting from and the economic influence of the changes in supply and demand for non-metallic mineral wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. Specifically, we construct an input–output (IO) table to analyze non-metallic mineral wastes to identify monetary and material flows between industries related to supply and demand in non-metallic mineral wastes. Based on the constructed IO table, we predict the material flow and value added brought about by non-metallic mineral wastes in the future by applying a linear programming technique. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains supply and demand for non-metallic mineral wastes and the related industries covered in this paper. We also compile an IO table for the analysis of non-metallic mineral wastes. Section 3 develops a linear programming model to predict material flows and value added in 2030. Section 4 investigates the empirical results. Finally, Sect. 5 summarizes the discussion and conclusion.",

Let A be an initial matrix of dimension N × M with row and column marginal totals \({\mathbf{u}}_{{\mathbf{A}}} = {\mathbf{Ae}}_{M}\), \({\mathbf{v}}_{{\mathbf{A}}}^{\prime } = {\mathbf{e}}_{N}^{\prime } {\mathbf{A}}\) where \({\mathbf{e}}_{N}\) and \({\mathbf{e}}_{M}\) are N × 1 and M × 1 summation column vectors with unit elements. Further, let \({\mathbf{u}} \ne {\mathbf{u}}_{{\mathbf{A}}}\) and \({\mathbf{v}} \ne {\mathbf{v}}_{{\mathbf{A}}}\) be exogenous column vectors of dimension N × 1 and M × 1, respectively. The problem is to estimate a target matrix X of dimension N × M at the highest possible level of its structural similarity (or resemblance, likeness, closeness, etc.) to initial matrix A subject to N + M equality constraints and under the consistency condition It is assumed that initial matrix A does not include any zero rows or zero columns, does not have less than N + M nonzero elements, does not include any rows or columns with a unique nonzero element, and does not contain any pairs of rows and columns with four nonzero elements in the intersections. Otherwise, it is advisable to clean matrix A from those undesirable features before applying any matrix updating method in practice. Clearly, the system of equations (1) is dependent at consistency condition (2) that provides an existence of target matrix X. However, it is easy to show that any N + M − 1 among N + M constraints (1) are mutually independent. Furthermore, it is evident that any feasible solution of matrix-updating problem X can be simply transformed into another one by letting, e.g., where ε is an arbitrary scalar, or and so on. Thus, general problem of matrix updating with a great variety of feasible solutions significantly depends on a definition of the measure for structural similarity between initial and target matrices. Various definitions of this measure generate a great manifold of different methods and techniques for matrix updating. A quite common approach to define the similarity measure is to use some objective distance function \(f\,\left( {{\mathbf{X}} - {\mathbf{A}}} \right)\) to be minimized subject to linear constraints (1) under the consistency condition (2). The main purpose of the article is to enhance the methods of this kind by defining and applying a new algebraic concept named homothetic paradigm.",2

In regard to the region, it overperforms Brazil and Argentina (72nd and 85ft place, respectively), but lags from others like Chile (44th place). Its position suggests that the country’s development falls within the better half of infrastructure-quality-providing countries, like other BRIC countries—namely China, India and Russia—and Turkey, which has a similar GDP to Mexico. However, it does not necessarily mean that Mexican infrastructure quantity stocks are delivered accordingly. Every year, Mexico spends large amounts of capital on economic infrastructure. Currently, the National Infrastructure Plan is an important driver for the energy, communication and transport sectors as a strategy to enhance the Mexican economy. President Enrique Peña Nieto has promised to spend 7.7 trillion pesos from 2014 to 2018, which would account for an annual average of 5.4% of GDP per year in that period, making it one of the largest investments in the Latin American region (Fay et al. 2017). Since Aschauer’s (1989) seminal work, and after many academic debates, it has been stated that under the right conditions, infrastructure may help reduce inequality (Calderón and Servén 2004; Fourie 2006; Leipziger et al. 2003), which in turn could lead to growth promotion (Aschauer 1988; Munnell 1990; Loayza and Oadawara 2010; Calderón and Servén 2008). As a critical component at the core of most public policies, infrastructure is used as a stimulus to activate economies by twofold. On one side, the demand agent conduces to a fiscal multiplier from the government’s investment, as an indirect effect. The supply agent, on the other side, originates from the assets’ building-capacity for economic growth, which is a direct effect and takes longer than the indirect effect to develop. Infrastructure is structured by types, sectors, levels and dimensions. There are two types of infrastructure: economic and social infrastructure. The former is segregated into five sectors (telecommunications, energy, transport, water and sanitation, and waste). The latter does not have clear-cut segregation. However, these are driven by social, political and cultural institutions, specifically in sectors like health, education, commercial, housing, and security or defense. Levels refer to the projects’ size development—namely municipal, state, national, among others, and dimensions are three: quantity, quality, and access.Footnote 1
 This assessment’s objective is to verify Mexico’s economic infrastructure quantity condition and its effect on growth by following three exercises: (1) address Mexico’s provision and trends of stocks by benchmarking with similar regions and industrialized countries in simple and conditional comparisons, (2) empirically estimate infrastructure’s effect on growth, and (3) with the infrastructure coefficient estimated in the regression, calculate Mexico’s infrastructure gap compared to regional leaders. I consider some of the limitations of previous infrastructure studies: these are (1) a lack or shortage of information, (2) failing to consider an integral variable for infrastructure, (3) failing to address adequate causal relationships, and (4) trend removal in the time series of the individual infrastructure stocks. Even though there have been massive efforts worldwide to gather data, the first main problem has been data availability.Footnote 2 In addition, it is not always consistent. In some cases, it cannot be summed or compared. For example, considering the transport sector, Australia and Spain’s National Government Statistics have changed the way they report their roads over time, making the information inconsistent and poor (Estache and Fay 2009; Gramlich 1994). Information gathered at state level and federal level can have different definitions, e.g., rural roads, where regional incumbents are the only ones to recognize them as roads and other government levels do not. However, even when the definition of infrastructure and measures are standardized, some issues exist—like causality between output and infrastructure stocks. It may be possible for infrastructure to improve real output while simultaneously economic growth shapes the demand for infrastructure services. Although mentioned by some authors, there is still no clear answer on how to proceed about it (Calderón et al. 2015; Estache and Fay 2009; Gramlich 1994). Endogeneity will cause a bias in the estimation for the infrastructure sectors if not treated for adequately (Aschauer 1989; Munnell 1990). Another econometric consideration is that the nature of the series for infrastructure stocks presents non-stationarity and tends to drift over time. Some have suggested that to remove the trend, the terms may be specified in first differences, which often yields results showing that the effect of public capital is small, sometimes negative, and generally not statistically significant (Munnell 1992; Gramlich 1994). Besides, first differencing destroys long-term relationship in the data, which is what is trying to be estimated most of the time in the first place. The variables should also be tested for co-integration, and adjusted and estimated accordingly (Munnell 1992). It is important to observe whether they grow together over time and converge their long-run relationship, or in other words, to what extent are they co-integrated (Calderón et al. 2015). Furthermore, results vary if either investment stocks or physical stocks are considered as proxies for infrastructure variables. Both measures have caveats. Starting with the monetary term, the cost of public investment does not account for the value of public capital (Aschauer 1989), meaning what you buy is not always what you get, or as Pritchett (2000) concludes “… the cost of public infrastructure is not the same increment to public capital…”. One reason is that spending does not measure efficiency (Hulten 1996). This issue is presented in Winston (1991) where he reviews the USA’ spending on roads with inefficient prices and concludes that investment should be reduced. Some of these inefficiency issues or distinct pricing may be related to possible acts of corruption surrounding the project (Pritchett 1996). On another note, the spatial characteristic of infrastructure levels may generate a bias on the infrastructure effect due to crowding-out effects from investments (Fedderke and Bogetic 2009). The spatial effect would require other kinds of methodologies like those provided by Anselin (1988) or Elhorst (2010) to estimate. Besides lacking spatial consideration, infrastructure investments also lack a time specification. They take time to show return rates (Calderón et al. 2015) and given the nature and magnitude of many infrastructure projects, which tend to be incubating projects, the investment’s impact on growth varies (Pritchett 2000). Not only that, but capital investment definitions are diverse. They may include different infrastructure sectors and types while also including non-infrastructure industrial, labor, and commercial activities. In the sense that it may consider overall public capital and not just infrastructure capital. Aggregate measures may hide the impact of infrastructure at a disaggregated level (Sánchez-Robles 1998; Fedderke and Bogetic 2009). Finally, since capital stock is not directly observable in a country, infrastructure investments must undergo a perpetual inventory method, which regards issues with the “beginning” and the “end” of the information. To calculate it you need (1) consistent time series data, (2) information on the initial stock and (3) information on the depreciation rate. Estimating the “beginning” or the initial stock of capital makes the methodology change among authors, which makes it inconsistent (Berlemann and Wesselhöft 2014) and, at the “end,” it assumes that while capital depreciates, its value never falls to zero. Physical measures are not perfect either. When Canning built his infrastructure stock dataset, he pointed out that the variables had high correlations among them as a weakness (1998). Moreover, a major concern for both kinds of measures, monetary and physical stocks, is the availability of data, but it is more problematic on the physical stock side, in the sense of variety of stocks. This may result in the use of physical infrastructure variables as flows (like energy consumption, instead of electricity generation at the state level), which build up on the demand side from society instead of the supply side, and will result in erroneous outcomes. Regardless of the measure used, infrastructure is subject to congestion (Sánchez-Robles 1998) and makes it more complicated to measure any kind of infrastructure outcome. Canning and Pedroni (1999) identify a growth maximizing level of infrastructure, where having resources allocated to another productive sector may outweigh the gain from having more infrastructure. If infrastructure stays below this level, it will generate growth (Calderón and Chong 2004). However, in some developing countries where the infrastructure gap is wide (assuming that the estimation is calculated by a consistent defnition for infrastructure), financing infrastructure is not feasible due to costs or other policy priorities (Straub 2008). In the end, if available, infrastructure physical stocks are less problematic. The issue with high correlations may be treated with principal component analysis (explained later). The second issue, congestion, may help observe the maximizing level for infrastructure.Footnote 3 Finally, the third issue, even though the desirable level of infrastructure may not be feasible to obtain, this assessment compliments knowledge on infrastructure optimal levels, and its impact on economic growth. For these reasons, infrastructure physical stocks are used for the estimation.",2

In 2014, while USA had a GDP per capita of more than fifty thousand dollars, Colombia presented a GDP per capita of less than eight thousand dollars.Footnote 1 Although there are serious criticisms to the GDP as a measure of well-being, this difference expresses a disturbing contrast that must be studied in detail. While this divergence between the USA and Colombia is of old date, there are countries that in the last 50 years have managed to close the income gap, leaving behind other developing economies. For example, in 1960 Korea had a GDP per capita smaller than the Colombian, but in 1990 the Asian country was already richer. In 2014, Korean GDP per capita was already over thirty thousand dollars, more than three times the Colombian GDP per capita. The literature says that the set of policies used by the Asian country, which caused this economic “miracle” or late industrialization process, were very different from Washington Consensus policies, largely based on manufacturing upgrading and characterized by strong intervention of the State (Wade 1990; Amsden 1992; Reinert 2007; Rodrik 2008; Stiglitz et al. 2013). The world is now attending to deep international economic changes. Countries such as Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Colombia, which were called to be the new engines of global economic growth, have begun to show symptoms of deceleration and crisis. As Rodrik (2015a) says, these countries didn’t show a coherent story of economic growth. In other words, those high rates of economic growth in the past decade were generated by the boom of commodities and not because of real productive sophistication. This was not the path followed by countries that achieved the status of developed recently, with the renowned examples of Korea and Japan. According to Rodrik (2015a), most of the emerging economies worldwide are now living a premature deindustrialization phenomenon. Manufacturing has been a key part in the structural transformation of the economies recently graduated as developed, and it has also been the more stable fountain of economic development in history (Rodrik 2013a). However, in Colombia since 1990 the share of manufacturing has plummeted (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that this impressive fall coincided with the adoption of Washington Consensus policies,Footnote 2 or “Apertura Económica” as it was called within the borders. Almost all the countries of the region share both the fall in the participation of manufacturing and the adoption of Washington Consensus policies. 
Source: Author’s calculations based on World Bank (2016) Colombia: manufacturing share. The fall in manufacturing participation in Colombia is not explained by an absolute fall in manufacturing output (Fig. 2). In fact, Colombian manufacturing output has increased in 68% in the last 35 years. However, this manufacturing growth has been tiny in comparison with those of successful industrializers. While Colombian manufacturing grew at an average of 1.6% annually between 1980 and 2015, Korean manufacturing did so at 8.6%. In the period mentioned, Korean manufacturing output multiplied sixteen times, while the Colombian did not even double. The fall and this difference make important to study in depth the determinants of Colombian manufacturing performance. 
Source: Author’s calculations based on World Bank (2016) Colombia: manufacturing output. The economic relevance of this work is that it identifies the most important economic explanation of the fall in the manufacturing share in Colombia and the region since the 1990s, and classifies this fall as a premature deindustrialization phenomenon. Likewise, it is also relevant because it advances in the identification of key manufacturing sectors, based on a different theoretical approach to the role of the State in the economy, in order to establish a new industrial policy for the country and to achieve truly structural transformation of the Colombian economy. In the second part of this work, there is going to be a review of the arguments that support a theory of state intervention for the emergence and consolidation of manufacturing. The third part is an empirical approximation to the causes of deindustrialization in Colombia and in the region. Finally, the fourth part presents an exercise of selective industrial policy, based on the product space methodology (Hausmann and Klinger 2006), in order to establish strategic manufacturing sectors to be promoted by the Colombian State.",6

If the focus of analysis is at only the country or inter-country level, the existing ICIO tables may be sufficient. In practice, however, many economic policy needs are at a country’s domestic regional level, while linking with the world market. For example, questions like how the 2008 financial crisis damaged the economy of Chinese Guandong province through various channels of GVCsFootnote 1 or how the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake impacted Korea’s semiconductor industry through GVCsFootnote 2 significantly challenge the existing ICIO approach. The conventional way of using ICIO-based economic models (including computable general equilibrium models) to answer the first question is to first evaluate the inter-country impact and then to conduct a top-down analysis at the domestic regional level. The response to the second question is to first conduct a bottom-up analysis to evaluate the impact of a specific region on the whole country and then to measure the inter-country impact. For both approaches, in the process of evaluating the inter-country impact based on the ICIO table, the target country is treated as a single entry (an economic point), without any information about its domestic regional heterogeneity. Namely, there is implicitly a strong assumption that all domestic regions have the same production function as the national average. This may potentially lead to a large estimation bias in economic analyses for the target country if it has domestic regions with various heterogeneities in terms of regional economic endowments, geographic locations, developmental stages, industrial structures, and foreign independency. Another example is that, in the USA, much of the chemical industry is concentrated in the South with large amounts of relatively clean natural gas-fired power plants. What remains of the steel industry is largely concentrated in the Upper Midwestern states, where coal-fired power plants dominate. If we use ICIO to estimate embodied emissions in US exports through domestic supply chains, an overestimation will likely occur for chemical exports, and an underestimation may occur for steel exports if more chemical exports are from the South and more steel exports are from the Upper Midwestern states. This is a crucial issue with the ICIO-type approach, which needs to be carefully treated in both economic and environmental analyses. One option to overcome this problem is to construct a regionally extended inter-country input–output (REXICIO) table containing the target country’s domestic regional information. This can directly provide information about linkages between a target country’s domestic production networks and international production networks. Some efforts have been reported in the literature. For example, Meng et al. (2013b) embedded China’s domestic inter-regional IO (IRIO) table into the world input–output table (WIOT) using a linear programing method. Their empirical results show that using the newly extended WIOT can both reduce the estimation discrepancy of China’s bilateral trade in value added and also elucidate the position and the degree of participation of China’s domestic regions in global value chains which cannot be explicitly measured by using China’s domestic IO table or the WIOT in isolation. This new WIOT has also been applied to environmental analysis (see Pei et al. 2016). Similar works can also be found in Cherubini and Los (2013), who link Italy’s IRIO table to the WIOT, and then illustrate Italy’s regional employment patterns in a globalizing world. Also, Dietzenbacher et al. (2013) linked Brazil’s IRIO IO table into the WIOT and evaluated the role of Brazilian regions in the global value chain. Another ambitious attempt is to link more countries’ domestic IRIO IO tables to existing ICIO tables [see Meng et al. (2013a) and Inomata and Meng (2013), who links Japan, China, and Korea’s domestic IRIO tables into the Asian International IO tables]. The aim of this paper is to develop a more consistent and flexible method for embedding a target country’s domestic IRIO table into an existing ICIO table. The existing efforts mentioned above can be considered a good starting point. However, some important problems in the existing works remain unsolved. One is consistency of terms used for valuation in the IO tables. For example, the official WIOT uses basic prices, while China’s IRIO table uses producer prices. Without appropriately adjusting China’s IRIO from producer’s prices to basic prices in advance, potential discrepancies may arise to some extent in the process of linking these two tables. This is mainly because taxation and transportation margin at the product level may be different across domestic regions or sectors. In addition, the import data in China’s IRIO table are at CIF prices, which also should be adjusted before linking with an ICIO table since tariff, import duty, and international transportation margins and insurance may vary across countries of origin at the product level. The other challenge is how to improve the reliability of the target country’s regional trade data (exports and imports for goods and services). These data provide very important information to be used in allocating the international trade flow between the target country’s domestic regions and other countries. However, domestic regional customs data may not provide true domestic destination information of imported goods and domestic origin information of exported goods. For example, officially published Japanese regional customs data are based on the reporter’s location information rather than that of producer and user locations. Therefore, when using a target country’s domestic regional customs data, careful treatment and adjustment should be done in advance. Another problem is the control and evaluation of estimation errors. Meng et al. (2013a) and Inomata and Meng (2013) use the so-called split method to link target countries’ domestic IRIO table with an ICIO table. This method keeps the balance of the existing ICIO column-wise, but without detailed treatments of row-wise estimation discrepancies. Meng et al. (2013b) use a linear programing method to do similar linking work resulting in a balanced ICIO table with a target country’s IRIO table embedded. However, the selection of constraint equations in the linear programing method is not unique. In order to get a converged result with the smallest discrepancy level, personal experiences play a very important role in their estimation. In order to overcome the above limitations, this paper introduces some new variables for adjusting the valuation format between different tables to be linked. We also improve the reliability of a target country’s domestic regional trade data by using the OECD end-use category for customs information. In the Sect. 2, we establish a stylized framework to compile the REXICIO table, and show how to use this table to study GVCs. In Sect. 3, we use China and Japan as an example to show the application results of the REXICIO tables in GVC research. Section 4 gives conclusion.",16

The scope of this new generation comprehensive trade agreement covered the traditional barriers to trade in both goods and services, investment and other trade-related areas. These areas referred to formal restrictions related to trade and investment activities, intellectual property rights, labor and environmental standards and issues and challenges related to digital technologies. In this form, the TPP deal could be the most important trade and investment pact that the world has witnessed since the creation of World Trade Organization (WTO) more than two decades ago (Schott 2013). The TPP agreement as signed in October 2015 appeared largely different from the several FTAs signed and implemented across the world in recent times. Some of the features which set this TPP agreement apart from the other trade agreements are: First, in terms of economic footprints in the world its members account for way larger share than those by most other recent trade agreements. The 12 member countries together account for 37.4% of world GDP, 11% of world population and 26.3% of total world trade in 2015. The intra-TPP trade accounts for 15.5% of total world trade (Table 1). Second, in terms of scope and coverage and depth of commitments to trade liberalization it is one of the most comprehensive trade agreements and that too involving both developed and developing countries. The implementation of the agreement is likely to lead to increased trade and investment opportunities in goods and services and increased market access among the member countries by lowering tariffs and easing the non-tariff barriers. Requirements like imports licensing, quality standards, custom rules, pre-shipment inspections and rules of origin which are often obstacles to free trade come within the scope of non-tariff barriers. TPP is set to encourage greater coherence in standards and regulations among its members. The existing tariff between the TPP member countries has come down significantly over the years from around 5.8% in 1996 to 2.8% in 2014 (Global Economic Prospects 2016) and is substantially low compared to international standards. The same is true for non-tariff barriers existing in these countries. These are due to the various other trade agreements, like NAFTA and ASEAN, that got created between the different members countries of TPP. Yet the TPP is set to lower these tariffs further and eliminate it completely by 2046. However, the countries are allowed different phasing out periods for their tariff and non-tariff liberalization (Fig. 1). 
Source: based on data from ITC Market Access Map database (available at http://www.macmap.org) Average intra-tariff (percent) of TPP countries (USA included) over time (2014–2046). Along with providing comprehensive market access to member countries by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, the TPP also aims at helping the development and deepening of supply chain among the member countries. The countries of the region have for a while been active participants of the worldwide supply chain integration as is indicated by the share of foreign value added in their exports which range from 15% in advanced countries of Australia, the USA and Japan to 40% in the developing countries of Malaysia and Singapore (Fig. 2). Facilitating these supply chains within the region calls for good physical connectivity through ports, roads along with policies that facilitate trade in intermediate goods and services and foreign investment. Thus, along with lowering of tariff and non-tariff restrictions, TPP is also likely to bring down the trade costs such as customs fees, port handling charges and the cost of time in trade between the member countries. 
Source: based on data from UN Comtrade database Intermediate imports of TPP countries (USA included) (US $ billion). The TPP, when announced, was undoubtedly the largest regional trade accord that history could have witnesses and, if approved by the member countries, it would have set new terms for the nearly US $28 trillion in trade and business investment between the parties to the deal. But this TPP deal hit a road block with Donald Trump winning the Presidential election in the USA in November 2016. Former US President Barack Obama treated trade deals as a priority during his tenure. And TPP was expected to bolster the position of the USA in the Asia–Pacific region, where China’s influence was growing by the day. But in Trump’s words this was a “horrible deal” that would favor big businesses and other countries at the cost of job’s and national sovereignty in the USA. Accordingly, on January 23, 2017, Trump signed the executive order which formally withdrew the country from the TPP trade deal. It has been largely held that this move by the President of the USA has effectively killed TPP for the other member countries too. However, some negotiating countries have still shown interest in taking this deal forward without the USA. At the same time, other countries, like Japan and Canada, are reluctant to move ahead and are currently looking at convincing the USA to reconsider its position on the agreement. The prevailing thought is that the TPP in its current form is dead and the other eleven countries must now form new deals. Thus, while all the debate and deliberation around the prospect of TPP continues, an important point to note is that the TPP deal does not include China, world’s largest merchandise trader, which had combined exports and imports worth US $3963.5 billion in 2015 (UN Comtrade). So the obvious question that arises is—What does TPP mean for China with the USA or without the USA? China routinely denounced the TPP till about 3 years back and held that it is possibly one of the many efforts to contain China. However, of late, China has given up this blanket opposition and has adopted a more nuanced attitude of “wait and see” (Naughton et al. 2005). Thus, though currently, China may not be ready to meet the demanding requirements of the TPP agreement but possibly might join the group in a few years from now.Footnote 1 Particularly, given the current status of the deal, there may be the potential for China to join it soon. Thus, the implications of the TPP on China do call for an in-depth study. The present study aiming to do this begins by investigating the pattern of China’s current trade with the TPP member countries. Thus, the rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents a discussion of China’s trade with the TPP member countries. Section 3 discusses the methodological framework. The data are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the results. The paper finally concludes in Sect. 6 with a summary of the findings and their policy implications.",1

In general, an economic model is regarded as an explanation of an empirical regularity if the model can reproduce the observed regularity under reasonable parameter restrictions. If economic models generally predict that an observed regularity is persistent across time and across countries (under reasonable parameter settings), we state that this regularity is an economic law.Footnote 1
 Since economic laws are statements (about the properties of economic variables), we can combine different laws and use logical operations to derive their direct implications. These implications can be regarded as predictions of economic dynamics based on relatively general and widely accepted economic laws.Footnote 2 As we will see in our paper, we can go much further: Since the laws are statements about the dynamic properties of variables, which can be translated into geometrical/topological properties of development paths, we can use the geometrical/topological concepts and theorems of mathematical dynamic systems analysis to derive predictions of dynamics on the basis of these laws. In general, this ‘positivistic approach’Footnote 3 of deriving predictions of economic dynamics on the basis of widely accepted economic laws can be interpreted as a meta-modeling approach, since it relies on the laws that are supported by different economic models (following different theoretical doctrines). Thus, in general, the predictions derived in such a way are less ideological or theoretical than the predictions of standard economic models and represent the theoretical consensus to some extent. In our paper, we use the positivistic approach described above to analyze structural change in the three-sector framework. In particular, we collect widely accepted laws of structural change and use them to predict the transitional and limit dynamics of long-run labor re-allocation across agriculture, manufacturing, and services in developed and developing countries.Footnote 4 The application of the positivistic approach for structural change modeling seems interesting for two reasons. First, structural change is one of the most persistent long-run phenomena of economic development having characteristics that are easily identifiable and stable across countries and time. The latter aspect is one of the core characteristics of an economic law, as stated above. Second, structural change in the three-sector framework can be modeled by a continuous trajectory on a bounded subset of a plane (cf. Stijepic 2015). Such a dynamical system is easily predictable due to its topological properties (cf. Guckenheimer and Holmes 1990, p. 42f.). In particular, many concepts and theorems (e.g., the Poincaré–Bendixson theory) of dynamic systems analysis are applicable to this type of dynamical system. Since as always in the empirical sciences, neither empirical evidence nor economic models imply unambiguously that an empirical observation is a regularity or even a law (because of, e.g., different data sources, measurement problems, and dissent between different schools of economic thought), it is debatable which of the empirical observations can be regarded as laws. Thus, we present different models based on different sets of laws, such that the readers can choose the models that correspond to their ideology. In particular, our set of models encompasses a conservative model (which is only based on the most accepted and least disputable laws) and several less conservative models (which rely on more disputable laws). Our results differ significantly from the results of the standard structural change literature (cf. the papers listed in Sect. 4.1.3). In particular, our results cover a wider range of possible structural change scenarios than the standard structural change literature does, since our predictions are less restricted by ideological assumptions.Footnote 5 For a summary of our models’ forecasts, see Sect. 5. The rest of the paper is set up as follows. In the next section, we discuss briefly the mathematical prerequisites and, in particular, the geometrical aspects of structural change analysis. In Sect. 3, we summarize the empirical regularities of structural change. In Sect. 4, we formulate different models (i.e., sets of laws) on the basis of the regularities postulated in Sect. 3, study their transitional and limit dynamics, and use these results to predict structural change in developed and developing countries. Concluding remarks are provided in Sect. 5.",3

For this reason, global warming is an urgent issue to address through effective CO2 emission reduction policies. Considering global CO2 emissions in 2013 by sector, the second largest volume comes from the transportation sector, which accounts for 23% of the global CO2 emissions. Because of a continued large contribution by the transportation sector, Melaina and Webster (2011) performed an analysis on the light vehicle sector in the USA and proposed practical measures for achieving CO2 reduction targets. In Japan, the transportation sector generated 17% of the total amount of CO2 emissions in 2012 (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism; MLIT 2013), which marks an 4% increase during 1990–2012, due to the increase in the transportation volume of passenger cars (Ministry of the Environment 2014). The market expansion of new and used passenger cars also affects the environment, because expanding the market of new passenger cars with relatively high fuel efficiencies (km/l) contributes to reducing CO2 emissions during the driving phase, whereas it increases CO2 emissions in the car manufacturing phase (Kagawa et al. 2011). An important point is that expanding the market of used cars with relatively low fuel efficiencies conversely contributes to increasing CO2 emissions in the driving phase, whereas zero emission is achieved the car manufacturing phase. Regarding the use of used products, Curran (2010) showed that extending product life spans through the reuse of furniture and appliances in the UK has an effect on reducing waste and raw materials. There are two relevant previous studies on life-cycle emissions in the driving phase that include the impact of the fuel efficiencies of motor vehicles and their annual travel distance: Ou et al. (2010) and Pauliuk et al. (2012). In Japan, the number of used car registrations in 2014 was 3.28 million, whereas new car registrations in the same year were 4.70 million (JADA: Japan Automobile Dealers Association 2015). This shows that the used car market has a strong influence on the current Japanese car market (JADA 2015). The number of used car registrations increased at an annual growth rate of 3% during 1990–2014 (Japan Light Motor Vehicle and Motorcycle Association 2015), and the market share of used cars increased 1.2-fold during the same period (JADA 2015). According to MLIT (2014), the average price of a used car in Japan is approximately ¥1 million, which is almost the same as in the USA and UK. However, the sizes of the used car market in the USA and UK are ¥33 trillion and ¥7 trillion, respectively, whereas the size of the market in Japan is ¥2.2 trillion. The numbers of used cars sold annually in the USA and UK in 2014 were 40.5 million and 7.1 million, respectively (National Independent Automobile Dealers Association 2014; British Car Auctions 2013), whereas 2.15 million used cars were sold in Japan, again being lower. The main reason for such differences in the used car markets between Japan, the USA, and UK is that consumers in the West can obtain more trustworthy information about vehicles, such as their maintenance and repair histories. Japan plans to adopt a traceability system by 2020 (MLIT 2014). However, it is not clear how much influence the expansion of the market share of used cars has had on the life-cycle CO2 emissions from the passenger car sector. In 2009, the Japanese government introduced a vehicle replacement scheme for the replacement of older cars with lower fuel efficiencies by new cars with higher fuel efficiencies in an attempt to reduce CO2 emissions from the transportation sector (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan 2016). With this background, Kagawa et al. (2013) proposed an environmental impact assessment method for assessing the effectiveness of scrappage schemes for reducing CO2 emissions through the entire life cycle of passenger cars. Lenski et al. (2010) had previously estimated the environmental benefits of introducing the “cash-for-clunkers” policy in the USA in 2009. However, since the assessment frameworks at that time (Lenski et al. 2010; Kagawa et al. 2011, 2013) did not consider vehicle lifetimes and the market for “used cars,” they ignored the environmental impacts of re-registering older cars as used cars. Before I analyze CO2 emissions in the automobile sector, I considered vehicle lifetimes in line with Kagawa et al. (2006), Müller (2006), Murakami et al. (2010), and Oguchi et al. (2010). The lifetime distributions also play an important role in material stock and flow analysis (Nakamura et al. 2014; Pauliuk et al. 2017). In this context, the lifetime distribution analysis has been applied in a wide range of durable goods or material such as personal computers (Babbitt et al. 2009), air conditioner (Rapson 2014), and buildings (Nomura and Momose 2008). This study considers the vehicle lifetimes and markets of both new and used cars and develops an automobile life-cycle input–output framework that considers the lifetimes and market shares of used cars. I used the car sales data during 1993–2014 (JADA 2015), a 2005 environmental input–output table (National Institute for Environmental Studies 2010), and the vehicle lifetime density function estimated by Kagawa et al. (2011). By applying the data sets to a life-cycle assessment framework proposed in this study, I address the question of how market expansion and lifetime extension of used cars affect life-cycle CO2 emissions through the entire economy. From the results, this study examines whether introducing a demand policy with a focus on used cars would increase environmental benefits. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 explains the methodology, Sect. 3 describes the data, Sect. 4 presents the results and discussion, and finally Sect. 5 gives conclusions, including further policy implications.",12

The plan explains that, in order to create a sound material-cycle society, it will be necessary not only to focus on societal material flow and improve resource productivity, but also to focus on societal material stock, to utilize stock more efficiently, and to accumulate stock that will increase social welfare (Ministry of the Environment 2013). A seminal study focusing on material flow is by Wolman (1965). Walman’s study described cities as organisms that have a metabolism: Materials and energy are fed into cities, while waste matter is discharged. By examining the process of inputs and outputs in a socioeconomic system, Wolman (1965) showed the importance of quantifying the amount of resources (e.g., food, fuel, and electricity) needed to sustain lives or production activities, and of analyzing the interactions between material and energy flows and their associated environmental problems. Fischer-Kowalski (1998) conducted a seminal study that considered the metabolism of cities from many different perspectives, such as biology, ecology, social theory, cultural anthropology, and social geography, and pointed out the importance of analyzing material and energy flows in a socioeconomic system. Inspired in part by this prior research, a variety of studies in recent years have analyzed the flows of energy, water, resources, waste matter, and even greenhouse gas emissions in a socioeconomic system (e.g., Haberl 2001; Duchin and Levine 2013; Minx et al. 2013; Ding and Xiao 2014; Nakamura et al. 2014). In addition to these flow analyses, dynamic studies that consider the accumulation of materials in a city are also very important for analyzing the metabolism of cities (Zhang et al. 2015). An example of a study aimed at estimating the stock of resources accumulated in a society is Hashimoto et al. (2007). They found that the estimated quantity of building waste in 2000 greatly exceeded the actual stock of building waste, and this gap was designated as “missing stock.” Furthermore, Tanikawa et al. (2015) used four-dimensional geographic information system (4D-GIS) and prefecture-level data to construct long-term time-series data on the stock of accumulated resources in Japan resulting from the construction of buildings and infrastructure (e.g., roadways, railways, airports, dams, sewerage systems, and sea ports). A number of other studies attempting to estimate the stock of accumulated resources in a society have also been performed around the world in recent years (e.g., Tanikawa and Hashimoto 2009; Zheng et al. 2012; Pauliuk et al. 2014; Fishman et al. 2014; Reyna and Chester 2015). In addition to material flow and stock analyses, it is also important to quantitatively analyze the environmental efficiency of a city in order to assess the sustainability of a city’s metabolism (Zhang et al. 2015). Huppes and Ishikawa (2007) classified environmental efficiency into the following four indicators: (1) environmental productivity (i.e., production or consumption value per unit of environmental impact), (2) environmental intensity (i.e., environmental impact per unit of production or consumption value), (3) environmental improvement cost (i.e., cost per unit of environmental improvement), and (4) environmental cost-effectiveness (i.e., environmental improvement per unit of cost). In an environmental efficiency analysis based on the indicators shown above, for example, Browne et al. (2009) considered the second indicator, environmental intensity, and estimated the ratio of waste discharge to product consumption in Limerick, Ireland. In addition, Zhang et al. (2013) considered the second indicator and estimated the ratio of waste displacement to resource displacement within an area of Beijing, China. However, these studies did not consider desirable outputs (GDP, etc.) generated by production activity and the factor inputs required the production activity and they did not analyze economic efficiency based on the input–output data. On the other hand, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is well known as an input minimization modeling technique (i.e., input-oriented DEA model) and an output maximization modeling technique (i.e., output-oriented DEA model) to estimate the efficiency of decision making units (Cooper et al. 2007). Tyteca (1996) provided a comprehensive overview related to environmental performance indicators and recommended using DEA that could simultaneously consider input, desirable output, and undesirable output to evaluate environmental performance. That study marked a turning point, and environmental efficiency analyses using DEA approaches have become very active in recent years (e.g., Färe et al. 2004; Kumar 2006; Sueyoshi and Goto 2012; Eguchi et al. 2015; Halkos et al. 2016; Emrouznejad and Yang 2017; Sueyoshi et al. 2017). Regarding an analysis that estimated the productive efficiency using a DEA approach in Japan, Nakano and Managi (2010) applied a DEA framework considering CO2 emissions as an undesirable output to analyze the environmental efficiency of production resulting from labor and the private capital stock of Japanese prefectures from 1991 to 2002. Using data for private capital stock in the monetary base, they found that environmental efficiency decreased over the analysis period. Another example of production efficiency analysis considering prefectural-level CO2 emissions includes a study by Hashimoto and Fukuyama (2017). However, when providing an effective policy guidance for urban planning, what is needed is production efficiency analysis using physical- rather than monetary-base private and social capital stock data. On the other hand, Eguchi (2017) analyzed changes in production efficiency resulting from the labor force and accumulated resources in Japan during the study period of 1970–2010. He found that although production efficiency increased in almost all of the prefectures between 1970 and 1990, it declined in approximately 80% of Japan’s prefectures, including highly populated prefectures such as Tokyo and Osaka, between 1990 and 2010. However, the environmental efficiency of production activities based on accumulated resources in the cities of Japan has not yet been analyzed because the DEA framework used in Eguchi (2017) does not account for the associated environmental burden. According to the Paris Agreement, Japan is obligated to reduce CO2 emissions by 26% relative to 2013 levels by 2030 (United Nations 2016). As such, conducting environmental efficiency analyses of CO2 emissions associated with production activities is very important. With this motivation, this study compares a “conventional” environmental efficiency indicator (i.e., production per unit of environmental impact) with a “DEA-based” environmental efficiency indicator and examines how the efficiency indicators obtained by the “simplified” efficiency analysis differ from those endogenously determined by the DEA analysis based on economic theory (Cooper et al. 2007). This study estimates the environmental efficiency of production activities based on the accumulated resources of 46 Japanese prefectures during the period ranging from 1992 to 2008. The accumulated resources in the physical base and CO2 emissions associated with the production activities in the 46 Japanese prefectures are taken into consideration. This study further analyzes changes in environmental efficiency of production activities based on the accumulated resources in Japan during the same period, and identifies prefectures where environmental efficiency had increased or decreased in order to explore possible ways of sustainable development in relation to resource accumulation. This paper is organized as follows. The methodology is described in Sect. 2, the data and results are presented in Sect. 3, and concluding remarks are given in Sect. 4.",2

Devadas,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Agriculture sector occupies the centre stage in shaping India’s socio-economic status. The economy of the second most populous country in the world is inextricably linked to the pulse of its agricultural success or failure. India has witnessed a significant increase in food grain production after green revolution, oilseeds production after yellow revolution, milk production after white revolution, fish production after blue revolution, and fruits and vegetables production after golden revolution, since independence. The agricultural development has been achieved due to the application of science and technology coupled with the positive policy implementation, and hard work of Indian farmers (Ahuja 2000). However, after nearly three and half decades in the post-green revolution period, the country still faces crisis each year in trying to meet the burgeoning demand for food by its growing population. Thus, the need of research and development in the field of agriculture for increasing the application of frontier technologies (i.e. information technology application in agriculture, precision farming, post-harvest technologies, mechanized farming and organic farming) cannot be denied, which is a feasible approach to achieve sustainable agriculture (Rao and Jeromi 2000; Ray et al. 2001; Srinivasan 2001). The best way to meet the increasing food demand for the rapidly growing population is to increase the production of crops using new agricultural technologies which can increase productivity of limited land resource and preserving its soil quality as well (Ray et al. 2001; Sarkar et al. 2013; Spiertz 2013; Wilson and Scot 1982). Studies suggest that agricultural productivity plays a key role in the process of industrialization and development, and there is a linkage between increase in agricultural productivity and poverty reduction (Ludena 2010; Prasad 1971; Schneider and Gugerty 2011; Lindh and Malmberg 2007; Weintraub 1976). Thus, regional development, which primarily aims at reducing the disparity in socio-economic status of the people, can be achieved by agricultural development (Mandal and Peters 1990; Mcloughlin 1970; Miller et al. 2009). The aim of the present research is to characterize the role of agriculture in economic development and identifying ways in which this role can be enhanced. In India, agriculture is the main source of resources that can be utilized in the emerging activities. Hence, successful industrialization requires a solution to the problems associated with the generation, transfer, and use of an agricultural resource surplus (Griffin and Enos 1970; Grabowski 2015; Kachru 2006). Generation of growing surplus demands a rising productivity of resource use in agriculture (Dasgupta 1974). This is achieved by successful agricultural and rural development, more specifically through technological and institutional development (Chand and Puri 2009; Winters and Stamoulis 1997). The use of modern varieties of irrigation and fertilizers is important aspects of higher growth in crop production. Studies suggest that modern inputs, such as improved seeds (HYVs), mechanized farm inputs, and organic manures, play an important role in agricultural development in a region (Kannan and Sundaram 2011; Letourneau and Goldstein 2001; Wilson and Scot 1982). The crop diversification with the adoption of modern technologies has boosted Indian agriculture to move from subsistence farming to intensive and technology-based cultivation for enhancing the productivity (Chattopadhayay and Roy 2011; Fontes et al. 2009).",6

The methodology has been widely used for performance assessment on various organizations in public and private sectors because of its computational practicality (i.e., solving by linear programming) and less assumption (e.g., nonparametric) on production relationship between inputs and outputs. It is indeed true that it has a high level of practicality. However, the conventional uses of DEA were often misguiding many applications, in particular, in guiding energy industries. See the recent book and article prepared by Sueyoshi and Goto (2017) and Sueyoshi et al. (2017), both of which have contained 693 articles published in energy-related SCI or SSCI-listed journals in the past four decades, where SCI and SSCI indicate Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index. They have claimed that the use of DEA in energy sectors has long been misguided for a long period. Of course, this study clearly acknowledges their academic contributions of the previous DEA studies in the area of DEA applied to energy and environment. The purpose of this study is to document how to use DEA for the performance assessment of energy sectors. To attain the research objective, we will review a recent energy trend in the world and then discuss a use of DEA from energy sectors. The energy is separated into primary and secondary categories. The primary energy is further classified into fossil fuels and non-fossil fuels. The fossil fuels include oil, natural gas, and coal, while the non-fossil ones include nuclear and renewable energies (e.g., solar, water, wind, biomass and other energy resources). Energy consumption is essential for developing economic prosperity in all nations. We consider electricity as a representative of secondary energy because it is produced through a use of primary energy sources. As the initial step for understanding energy and its trend, this study summarizes a general trend of energy whose consumption has been increasing along with an economic development and a population increase in the world and then extends the general trend to a use of DEA applied to energy and environment. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a world energy trend. Section 3 describes primary energy. Section 4 discusses secondary energy. Section 5 discusses how to apply DEA for the energy sectors. Section 6 concludes this research along with future extensions.",19

One example is the attribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of all industries in an economy to the final demand of a particular product. This metric is called the carbon footprint of the product (Gao et al. 2014; Peters 2010; Wiedmann 2009). More precisely, it is the cradle-to-sale, life cycle inventory of total upstream GHG emissions released during the production of the product. TIMs (denoted as m in the following equations) are the typical result of a demand pull, Leontief Type I calculation in the standard Leontief quantity model (Miller and Blair 2009, p. 447): where f is a matrix of direct intensity factors (or direct impact multipliers, DIMs), i.e. factors that represent the direct impact intensity of an industry (or sector) in the form of the total impact F of this industry divided by the industry’s total output X (i.e. \({\mathbf{f}} = {\mathbf{F}} \cdot \widehat{{\mathbf{X}}}^{ - 1}\)). 
I is an identity matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere. A is the technology coefficient matrix, calculated as the product of the input–output transaction matrix T and the inverse matrix \(\widehat{{\mathbf{X}}}^{ - 1}\) of diagonalised total industry output (i.e. \({\mathbf{A}} = {\mathbf{T}} \cdot \widehat{{\mathbf{X}}}^{ - 1}\)). 
L is the standard Leontief Inverse (\({\mathbf{L}} = \left( {{\mathbf{I}} - {\mathbf{A}}} \right)^{ - 1}\)). 
m is the resulting matrix of total impact multipliers with the same dimensions as the f matrix (usually row vectors). To provide detailed information regarding the origins of impacts along the production (supply) chain of a product, its TIM can be decomposed into contributions from sectors involved directly or indirectly in the production. It may be of interest to know in detail which industries or which products contribute the most to the total impact, for example, if the aim is to reduce impacts (e.g. climate mitigation, resource efficiency and cost savings) or to increase factors of production (e.g. employment and profits). In the following, this paper will distinguish between impact contributions from industries and from products and will elaborate on two different ways of decomposing TIMs in a supply and use table (SUT) framework.  A SUT framework shows the sales of products to industries (intermediate demand) in the use table part and the value of products produced by industries in the supply table part (Eurostat 2008). It can be regarded superior to a symmetric (industry-by-industry or product-by-product) input–output table, in the sense that more original information on sales and production structures is preserved (Rueda-Cantuche 2011). In particular, information on co- or by-production is valuable for applications in industrial ecology and related fields. Lenzen and Rueda-Cantuche (2012) demonstrate how, in a SUT framework, impact satellite data can be assigned to both industries and products and that total impact multipliers are obtained for both entities.Footnote 1
 Whilst impact analyses have been performed in SUT frameworks many times (e.g. Fry et al. 2015; Kagawa and Suh 2009; Lenzen et al. 2004; Malik et al. 2014, 2016; Suh et al. 2010; Wachsmann et al. 2009; Wiedmann et al. 2006, 2011) and whilst the decomposition of TIMs has been described in general terms before (Nakamura and Nansai 2016, section 3.7.1), a decomposition that explicitly distinguishes industries and products in a generalised SUT framework has—to the knowledge of the author—not been described yet. This note provides the mathematical description of SUT-based TIM decompositions in the following section as well as a worked example in the form of an Excel worksheet and MATLAB code as Additional files 1 and 2. Results from the worked example are presented in the figures.",8

Once the meaning of market clearing is explained, most laymen will have difficulty in understanding such a position, particularly in Europe. Malinvaud (1982, p. 870). 
The global financial crisis that has struck in 2008 and the ensuing global recession of 2009–2012 have led to a renewed interest in macroeconomic adjustment and macroeconomic management. At a paradigmatic level, standard approaches—be they more of a neo-classical or Keynesian nature—appear to be inadequate to explain the complete patterns and persistence of fluctuations seen during the crisis. Even the recent generation of New Keynesian [including the s.c. dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)] models appears to be able to deliver only partially adequate explanations for the observed adjustments as a result of the financial crisis. At the policy level, unconventional monetary and fiscal policy measures, like the ultra-loose quantitative easing in the USA and the large fiscal stringency plans in Europe, appeared to not have had the desired effects and are widely held to have inadequate policy responses. In light of these experiences, this paper seeks to fill a lacuna by integrating the earlier literature on disequilibrium analysis into modern dynamic macroeconomics, resulting in a New Keynesian disequilibrium model. The strengths of disequilibrium macroeconomics are that it does not need to rely on general equilibrium principles and allows for the possibility that the economy is moving through different disequilibrium regimes over time. The motivation of this paper is not only to analyze the interesting results of such an integration of disequilibrium analysis into modern dynamic macroeconomics. Using this approach, we also want to provide the reader with new perspectives when studying the current financial and economic crisis and the policy reactions observed. In fact, it is quite possible we like to argue that the large macroeconomic adjustments and the less effective policy strategies we observe are also caused by regime switches that occur along the way. For example, an expansionary fiscal policy that would seem effective in a Keynesian-oriented regime becomes rather ineffective in a neo-classical-oriented regime, and a fiscal consolidation regime could be counter-productive in a Keynesian-oriented regime but has more positive effects in a neo-classical-oriented regime. Moreover, such regime switches should not be seen as rare events, but can take place quite frequently our examples suggest. Regime switches imply that we do not observe the smooth, intuitive adjustment dynamics, typical for New Keynesian models, but rather non-smooth saw-toothed adjustments that are hard to predict and complicate economic policies.Footnote 1
 Section 2 summarizes the main principles from the literature on disequilibrium macroeconomics. Section 3 develops a model that incorporates disequilibrium analysis into a stylized New Keynesian model. Section 4 uses simulation examples to study the dynamic properties of the macroeconomic fluctuations produced by macroeconomic shocks in the presence of such short-term macroeconomic disequilibria. Section 5 considers the effects of varying the rigidity of prices versus the rigidity of wages, one of the crucial factors in the adjustment dynamics of the model. The conclusion of the paper summarizes its main findings.",

The average annual fresh water resources are estimated at 22 billion cubic metres, which is equivalent to 730 m3/capita/year. This figure is already lower than the threshold between water-stressed and scarce areas defined internationally to 1000 m3/capita/year. Groundwater resources account for about 20% (4173 hm3), of this average while surface water account for 80% (18,248 hm3) of the total. On the geographical distribution side, the water resources in Morocco are unevenly distributed over space. As shown in Table 1, the northern river basins Sebou and Loukkos contain for about 47% of the total water resources in Morocco, while they are home to only 19% of the total population and cover only 7.43% of the country’s area. The structure of water demand in Morocco is dominated by the agricultural sector. In most river basins, the agricultural sector absorbs for about 86% of the total water use, compared to 2% for domestic use and 3% for industrial use. Over the last few decades, Morocco has been facing a strong and fast water demand increase due to population expansion, irrigated agriculture, flourishing foreign trade and changing standard of living and lifestyles. The continued increase of water demand has imposed a height pressure over national scare water resources. To meet increasing water demand, efforts have been focused on supply side solutions by building hydrological infrastructures for water resources collecting, storage and distribution. The focus only on the supply side has led to neglect the way in which water is used. As a result, the natural quality of surface and groundwater resources has been dramatically deteriorated, groundwater resources have been overexploited in many areas, and the mobilizable conventional water resources have been almost mobilized (Economic, social and Environmental Concil 2014). From Fig. 1, it can be seen that, in 2012, significant parts of surface water resources are in bad to very bad quality in several river basins. This is the case of, for example, Loukkos (1), Sebou (2), Boureg Reg (4) and Tensift (6) river basins whose surface water resources in bad to very bad quality account for about 91, 29, 35 and 34%, respectively, of their total resources. Likewise, Fig. 2 shows that each of the river basins 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 has up over 50% of their groundwater resources in bad to very bad quality. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows that there has been a severe overexploitation of ground water resources in the river basins 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8.

Therefore, under the current water situation, in order to meet the projected demands in upward trend, Morocco should resort to non-conventional water resources (for examples, by purifying Wastewater, desalinate seawater). This option has already been adopted by Moroccan Water planners, especially to satisfy water demand of irrigated agriculture in low water endowments areas. Thus, Moroccan water sector is now at a certain step in the expansionary phase with rising financial, social and environmental costs of developing new water supplies, increasing conflicts and competition between water users and appearance of the negative externalities. In other words, we have arrived at the period that Randall (1981) titled “maturing water economy”. In this context, it is admitted that water supply development paradigm has stalled and become ineffective in Morocco. In fact, any attempt at bridging the gap between water supply and demand must explore solutions in the demand side. The major challenge facing demand-side water management approach today is to conciliate economic growth and rational use of water resources. The ultimate objective of measures aimed at demand management issues should be to use water sustainably. Sustainable water use approach was derived from the notion of sustainable development that emerged in the late 1980s as a response to the line of thought that has been highlighting the future effects likely to arise from the conflictive relationship between economic growth and the natural resources uses. This relationship is marked by a problem of exhaustion of non-renewing natural resources, and overexploitation of renewable resources. Sustainable development is defined by Brundtland Commission report as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987). This definition point up the current and future generations well-being interdependences, which are closely related to the natural resource endowments. In the same way, sustainable water use can be defined as “that pattern of use which ensures satisfaction of needs for both the present and future generations” (Bithas 2008). In this sense, using water, under the constraint that imposes the concern of maintains them for future generations, constitutes the great challenge that current generations must overcome. The crucial issue at hand is to figure out ways to put in practice this notion. This issue is still a subject of debate. Nevertheless, in the field of water research, it is largely allowed that any attempt at formulating effective water policy toward sustainable water use requires recognizing the relationships established between the economy and water use (Wang et al. 2009; Manase 2010). However, an integrated water–economic analysis requires an integrated information system bringing together economic and water information. This was the basic idea behind the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting for Water (SEEAW) developed by the United Nations (United Nations Statistics Division 2006) which is a more elaborate version of the framework presented in the Handbook of National Accounting Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting-2003 (United Nations, et al. 2003). Nevertheless, several countries, including Morocco, have not yet succeeded in carrying out an integrated water information system. An interesting similar method to analyse the interactions between water and the economy is de input–output (I–O) model of sectoral water use which is a development of the energy use I–O model developed in the early 1970s which is, in turn, an extension of the Loentief I–O model. The basic model developed by Wassily Loentief in the late 1930s is a system of linear equations; each equation describes the distribution of an economic sector’s product throughout the economy (Miller and Blair 2009). With the raising need of a system that provides information on the economy and the environment, Leontief (1970) added to the I–O table a row vector and a column vector to represent, respectably, sectoral emissions of pollutant and the pollution eliminated by the abatement activities. This extended framework has been broadly used (e.g. Leontief and Ford 1972; Stone 1972; Tamura and Ishida 1985; Førsund 1985; Labandeira and Labeaga 1999, 2002; Alcántara and Padilla 2009). In the wake of the oil crisis of 1973, energy consumption has become the main focus of researchers interesting on natural resources consumption. Thus, an energy I–O model has been developed and extensively used to investigate several kinds of questions relating to energy use and its relationships especially with the economy and the environment. Generally, most of these studies investigate sectoral energy consumption and the energy cost of goods or services (e.g. Clark and Herendeen 1975; Clark et al. 1978; Proops 1977, 1988), the source of changes in energy consumption and emissions by means of the structural decomposition analysis (e.g. Rose and Chen 1991; Lin and Polenske 1995; Chang and Lin 1998; Machado et al. 2001; Ma and Stern 2008; Lim et al. 2009; Weia et al. 2016; Hammond and Norman 2012) as well as the energy–environment relationships and the impact analysis of environmental and economic policy scenario (e.g. Gay and Proops 1993; Casler and Rafiqui 1993; Pearson and Smith 1991); Lenzen 1998; Hawdon and Pearson 1995; Oliveira and Antunes 2004; Llop and Pié 2008; Oliveira et al. 2014). Whit regard to water issues, studies that analyse the relationships between the economic system and water consumption using the I–O model have generated a substantial literature. According to Velázquez (2006), the first operating water I–O model was constructed by Lofting and Mcgauhe (1968). Since this earliest study, a wide range of water issues have been addressed through the I–O analysis. These comprise water reallocation analysis (e.g. Harris and Rea 1984; Howe et al. 1990; Llop 2013), analysis of the economic impacts of water policy scenarios (e.g. Llop 2008; Dietzenbacher and Velázquez 2007) and a large number of studies that analyse the relationships between the productive structure water use and water pollution, intersectoral water relationships and virtual water trade (e.g. Chen 2000; Lenzena and Foran 2001; Okadera et al. 2006; Velázquez 2006; Dietzenbacher and Velázquez 2007; Guan and Hubacek 2008; Zhao et al. 2009; Wang and Wang 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2010; Chapagai and Hoekstra 2011; Zhan-Minga and Chen 2013; Wang et al. 2014). In Morocco, water has been studied from several perspectives. However, little is known about the way in which the water sector as a whole is linked to the economic structure. Indeed, in order to alleviate water scarcity, Morocco needs to curb water demand. Such a measure requires, in turn, a complete understanding of the water flows, on the one hand, from the environment to the economy and, on the other hand, within the economy. Water flows from the environment to the economy consist of the withdrawals of water from the environment by the economic units (economic sectors and households). An analysis of those flows provides information on the direct relationships between water resources and the economic units. Moreover, the water flows within the economy consist of water transactions between each national economic sector and the rest of the world and between national economic units. Modelling the water transaction between national economic units allows us to determine the intersectoral water relationships which are, in turn, very useful data for integrated water–economic analysis. Further, it is also very important to determine the destination of water after it has been used in the production process of goods and services by distinguishing between domestic and foreign destination of water. Such analysis allows us to evaluate, on the one hand, the impact of domestic demand on water resources by quantitatively evaluate the water footprint of Morocco and, on the other hand, the impact of trade with the rest of the world on national water resources by quantifying the virtual water flows. The term virtual water was introduced by Allan (1993). It is used to refer to the freshwater required in the production process of goods and services. This concept is particularly related to trade. The idea behind it is that water scarce countries could reduce their scarcity by exporting goods and services whose production requires low quantities of water and importing goods and services whose production requires high quantities of water. This trade pattern has emerged as a virtual water strategy to alleviate water scarcity. The impact of domestic demand on water resources is evaluated by the water footprint of the area concerned. The term water footprint was introduced by Hoekstra and Hung. It was defined as the volume of freshwater needed for the production of the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of an area (Hoekstra and Chapagain 2007). In Morocco, there is need to cover all this important water–economy interaction in order to provide the policy makers with relevant information for designing integrated policies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to fill the knowledge gaps by developing and applying an I–O model of water use to Moroccan economy. However, we will limit our analysis to the relationships between the national economic sectors and the national water resources as well as the intersectoral water relationships in order to explore the inter-linkages between water use, and the productive structure, and providing indicators clarifying the economic and environmental decision-making. The method used in this paper is the same as that used, for example, by Zhang et al. (2011), Zhao et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2013) in water footprint analyses. However, we will limit ourselves in this paper to just analyse water use intensity of each economic sector in Morocco. In the framework of virtual water, sectoral water use intensity can be defined as “the virtual water content” of its product (the water used to produce one monetary unity of the product of a given sector). Quantifying the sectoral and the total water footprint of Morocco as well as the virtual water trade analysis will be the subject of a future study. Thus, the present paper claims to achieve the following objectives: First, adapt the conventional Leontief I–O model to water resources use. Second, investigate the relationships between water use and the economic sectors as well as the intersectoral water relationships, and find out the most direct and indirect water consumers. Third, in order to demonstrate the danger of neglecting indirect water use on water resources, we wonder what would be the amount of change in total sectorial water use and in the total quantity of water consumed by the economy as a whole when there are changes in final demand addressed to the high indirect use water sector compared to the effect of a similar change in the final demand addressed to the large direct water users. We will try to bring reply to this question by means of impact analysis. Finally, our fourth objective consists in leading an analysis aiming at determining the economic benefit of water use.",11

Farmers who lack the means to acquire agricultural information from formal sources often rely on information within their informal social network (Boahene et al. 1999; Lyon 2000) and transfer agricultural knowledge through social interactions (Conley and Udry 2010). Social network approaches posit that an individual’s behavior is influenced by relations, technical ties, and networks more than by the norms and attributes that an individual possesses (Yang and Tang 2003). Interpersonal interaction plays a significant role in facilitating learning processes as learners actively build knowledge by formulating ideas into words, which are built upon the reactions and responses of others. Despite the importance of networks as a means for information facilitation, Newman and Dale (2005) and Bodin et al. (2006) argue that “not all social networks are created equal.” They highlight the importance of distinguishing between “bonding” (interactions between family members, friends, and neighbors) and “bridging” (extend outside the community and provide access to different information and resources) ties. Balancing connections to both ties equally may improve people’s economic and social well-being (Wu and Pretty 2004; Berrou and Combarnous 2012) and enhance community development and survival likelihoods after a natural disaster (Hawkins and Maurer 2010). Some literatures have partially studied how the social structure of a village can affect the facilitation of social learning and adoption vis-a-vis improving the productivity of farmers (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995; Conley and Udry 2001; Romani 2003). However, these studies largely emphasize on final adoption and not the process of information solicitation. Literature exploring the effects of an individual’s community network structure on learning mechanisms during knowledge transfer activities is still limited. Examining learning effectiveness requires a field experimental design to understand fully the role of an individual’s network position in acquiring information, in addition to the incorporation of spatial aspects, because information transfer is often a function of geographic proximity. There has thus far been insufficient attention to investigations that combine the effects of an individual’s network connections and network structure, as well as spatial processes, upon influencing knowledge-gathering mechanisms. We intend to fill this gap in the literature by arguing that while both personal and structural networks are equally important as positive determinants of information gathering, they may have differential effects in terms of the transmission of agricultural knowledge. Our contributions are threefold: First, we conduct a field experiment in the context of farmers’ learning during agricultural training to explore the effects of personal networks upon farmers’ learning performance. To serve the purpose, we make a clear distinction between friendship networks and advice networks with both “bonding ties” (peers) and “bridging ties” (government official) as key determinants of farmers’ learning performance. Bonding ties are interactions between family members, friends, and neighbors in tightly connected networks, while bridging ties extend outside the community and provide access to different information and resources (Putnam 2001; Woolcock 2001). Friendship networks are more socially oriented in nature, while advice networks consist of relations through which individuals share information, assistance, and guidance that are related to the completion of their work. Second, we also examine how the structural properties of farmers’ local networks affect learning outcomes during formal agricultural training. While individual learning is undoubtedly a personal cognitive activity, it is also very likely to be influenced by social forces in that a person’s everyday interactions will tend to enhance or undermine learning (Bogenrieder 2002). To meet this objective, we investigate farmers’ positions in their local neighborhood, how central their position is compared to others who belong to the same group, and how this affects learning outcomes. Third, in the context of inferential regression analysis, we control for spatial autocorrelation as the explanatory variables are likely to be dependently distributed when farmers live close to each other. Spatial panel models are a powerful econometric tool for the estimation of spatially dependent cross-sectional time-series models. We found that ties to peer advice networks correspond to better learning outcomes, and the centrality of an individual’s position in a farming community strongly relates to their knowledge-gathering abilities to some extent. However, we also found that when the role of bridging ties is unfulfilled, irrelevant information that could potentially be adversarial for learning might be transferred instead. Learning is shaped not only by the number of connections, but also by the quality of network sources and their relevance to the information being sought. Furthermore, farmers occupying central positions within their community may be more familiar with facilitating problem-solving activities as they are used to conducting effective coordination of actors and resources in their local network, resulting in better learning outcomes to some extent. The paper is organized as follows: conceptual framework and hypotheses; data collection and experimental design; estimation methods; results; and finally our discussion and conclusions.",40

The challenge on the climate change makes the conventional profit-driven business logic and practice inappropriate and incompatible with a worldwide trend toward a sustainable society. It is necessary for firms to change their business operations to adapt to various regulations for GHG emission reduction.  Although the scientific claim proposed by the IPCC is very important, this study can easily imagine that no organization at the level of nations and companies pay serious attention the claim, because the IPCC within the UN does not have any clear implementation strategy from business and policy perspectives. We also combat not only the global warming and climate change but also other types of various pollutions (e.g., air, water and nuclear waste pollutions). It may be true that all the entities (i.e., nations and companies) prefer the development of their clean images, indeed, so that they can attain their economic prosperities. The reality may be different from the truth. Just a green image is important for them. A typical example can be found in the recent corporate scandal of Volkswagen in 2015 that has been long cheating on the CO2 emissions produced by cars. See also the new Repablican goverment starts neglecting the international agreement in the United States. The purpose of this study is to conceptually and theoretically examine the corporate sustainability (i.e., economic success and pollution prevention at the corporate level) from Damages to Return (DTR) where DTR indicates a level of change on undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2) by increasing one unit of a desirable output (e.g., unit production). The goal to establish a sustainable society requires a new methodology that can integrate the companies’ environmental measures with their operational measures in such a manner that it provides a holistic assessment for overall performance. This study proposes a usage of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a practical approach to evaluate the unified (operational and environmental) performance of private and public organizations from the perspective of corporate sustainability. The proposed DEA approach has several advantages over existing methods in production economics. First, it incorporates four disposability concepts such as natural disposability and managerial disposability as well as these conceptual combinations. Outputs and inputs, characterizing companies’ operational and environmental performance, are separated under these disposability concepts. Moreover, the proposed approach can identify effective investment opportunities for GHG abatement by utilizing the concept of congestion on undesirable outputs. This study summarizes both business and policy implications obtained from the proposed DEA application. All abbreviations and nomenclatures used in this study are summarized as follows: DC: Desirable Congestion, DEA: Data Envelopment Analysis, DMU: Decision Making Unit, DTS: Damages to Scale, DTR: Damages to Return, RTS: Returns to Scale, RTD: Returns to Damage, UC: Undesirable Congestion, URS: Unrestricted, UEN: Unified Efficiency under Natural disposability, UEM: Unified Efficiency under Managerial disposability, X: a column vector of m inputs, G: a column vector of s desirable outputs, B: a column vector of h undesirable outputs, \(d_{i}^{x}\): an unknown slack variable of the ith input, \(d_{r}^{g}\): an unknown slack variable of the rth desirable output, \(d_{f}^{b}\): an unknown slack variable of the fth undesirable output, λ: an unknown column vector of intensity (or structural) variables, \(R_{i}^{x}\): a data range related to the ith input, \(R_{r}^{g}\): a data range related to the rth desirable output, \(R_{f}^{b}\): a data range related to the fth undesirable output, \({{v}}_{{i}}\): a dual variable of the ith input, \({{u}}_{{r}}\): a dual variable of the rth desirable output, \({{w}}_{{f}}\): a dual variable of the fth undesirable output and σ: a dual variable to indicate the intercept of a supporting hyperplane on production and pollution possibility set. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes previous research efforts on DEA applied to energy and environment. Section 3 discusses underlying concepts incorporated into the proposed DEA environmental assessment. Section 4 describes mathematical models under natural and managerial disposability. Section 5 discusses how to incorporate a possible occurrence of desirable congestion, or eco-technology innovation, into the proposed DEA formulations.

The industry has matured so much that most households hold many credit cards and most consumers use credit cards as means of payment. They usually maintain their records on credit cards. In the USA, a total amount of credit card balances is about $700 billion. Because of the wide usage of credit cards, the term of cards is becoming a major selling point in addition to some other attractive offers (e.g., balance transfer). Every credit card company tries to offer good terms in many forms to attract more customers and encourage existing customers to borrow more. The credit card company gives offers with different combinations of interest rates and fees with different promotion durations. Under such a business environment, the company raises a business inquiry regarding how consumers response to different offers and what specific components of the offers are. Providing many attractive offers, credit card companies have a business inquiry regarding how consumers respond to their different contract offers. A number of research efforts previously examined a consumers’ choice and an effect of offers. For example, Shui and Ausubel (2004) found that more consumers accepted an introductory offer which had a lower interest rate with a shorter duration than a higher interest rate with a longer duration. Meanwhile, Agarwal et al. (2006) assessed the rationality by using a credit card experiment dataset, in which consumers made their financial decisions between two contracts with two combinations on annual fees and interest rates. Unfortunately, their studies focused on the type of offers on credit cards. Balance transfer offers were not examined in these studies, but currently becoming a more popular and important issue to credit card companies than before. Recently, different types of products and offers are proposed along with the development of a credit card market. To maximize the profit, companies are interested in which type of offers can provide an impact on consumers’ behavior more and further stimulate them more to borrow money. Jappelli (1990) has discussed who is credit constrained in the U.S. economy and this study could be helpful to credit card companies. Later, Musto and Souleles (2006) used a unique panel dataset of credit bureau records to measure the ""covariate risk"" of individual consumers and provided insight into the nature of the shocks hitting different types of consumers. Previous studies only analyzed a single type of offers by card companies. For example, Shui and Ausubel (2004) examined the pre-approved solicitation offer. Agarwal et al. (2007) analyzed federal income tax rebate to consumers. As an extension of such balance transfer offer analyses, this research investigates business implications by comparing between the cash back and the balance transfer in order to examine which offer is more profitable to credit card companies. To attain the research objective, this study examines consumer behavior by analyzing the effects of a balance transfer (BT) offered from a credit card company which is often accompanied with consumer’s short-term finance. Moreover, comparing between BT offers and cash-back offers, this study attempts to examine a business implication: Which offers are more effective in impacting consumers’ short-term finance. To obtain the implication, this study uses a randomized dataset provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS bank). An important feature of the dataset is that it contains account information both from the specific credit card company (CCC) and from the Equifax (EFX) bureau for every consumer. The EFX bureau is one of the three largest American credit agencies founded in 1899 that reports and maintains credit information on over 400 million consumers worldwide for every corresponding month. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous studies on the credit card market and consumers’ behaviors. This section also specifies the position of this study by comparing it with the previous studies. Section 3 describes the BT offer and dataset used in this study. The multinomial choice model is utilized in Sect. 4 to measure consumers’ choices on the offer. Section 5 estimates the total effect of averaged financial variables from consumers’ behavior to the offer. The section also visually describes its monthly paths. Section 6 summarizes estimation results. Section 7 discusses business implications and describes which offer is better for a credit card company in terms of stimulating consumers’ short-term finance behavior. Finally, Sect. 8 summarizes this research along with future extensions.",
6.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,16 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-017-0065-z,Feedback policy rules for government spending: an algorithmic approach,December 2017,Ilias Kostarakos,Stelios Kotsios,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most important objectives of economic policy is to ensure, via the appropriate manipulation of the available policy instruments (control variables), that the economic system tracks, as closely as possible, a desired path for the policy targets (outputs). One of the approaches that has been utilized for the design of economic policy is the feedback approach, stemming from the mathematical control theory literature. Various aspects of the feedback methodology have been utilized for the purposes of policy design for more than 50 years, starting with the use of PID controllers in the seminal paper by Phillips (1954). These aspects range from (stochastic) optimal feedback control (see, among others, Amman and Kendrick 2003; Christodoulakis and Levine 1987; Christodoulakis and Van Der Ploeg 1987; Leventides and Kollias 2014) to nonlinear (Athanasiou et al. 2008; Athanasiou and Kotsios 2008; Kotsios and Leventidis 2004) and stochastic control applications (Dassios et al. 2014). The importance of feedback rules for policy design is evident from the fact that for more than 20 years monetary policy decisions have been, to a large extent, based on the Taylor rule (see Taylor 1993); this is a linear feedback policy rule stipulating (in its simplest form) that the interest rate is set based on deviations of inflation and GDP from target levels of inflation and potential GDP, respectively. It is interesting to note here that Taylor presented a rule that had fixed settings for the parameters; in particular: where r is the federal funds rate, p the rate of inflation and y the percentage deviation of real GDP from a target (e.g., potential output). The rule stipulates that, for example, if GDP exceeds its full-employment level, then nominal interest rates need to be increased. One of the advantages of adopting the feedback framework is that it allows to explicitly take into account the time lags associated with the conduct of economic policy, since they can be incorporated into the dynamics of the model and the feedback policy rule (Kendrick 1988). Most importantly, the feedback methodology allows for more frequent (and, possibly, smaller) interventions by the policymaker, which are likely to result in a smoother transition path for the economy (see Kendrick and Amman 2014; Kendrick and Shoukry 2014). Our aim in this paper is to utilize the algorithmic feedback control framework for the design of short-term fiscal policy interventions. That is, we want to design linear feedback policy rules for the fiscal policy instruments available so that predetermined (fixed) desired sequences for the policy targets (GDP and public debt levels) are simultaneously tracked. In particular, we assume that the policymaker has at his disposal two instruments: expenditures related to compensation of public sector employees, social benefits, etc. (i.e., expenditures that cover individual and collective consumption) and expenditures related to investment projects (e.g., infrastructure) that will be funded by the government (either via its own budget or by using external funding such as EU structural funds or the funds available from the so-called Juncker Investment Plan). These investment expenditures are subject to several time lags (including, among others, legislative, design and implementation lags), and as a result, they will affect the economy with a possibly substantial delay; however, the feedback mechanism used allows us to explicitly incorporate these lags into the design of the fiscal policy rules. These rules will provide the exact sequence of the policy instruments necessary to ensure that the target levels of GDP and public debt will be simultaneously met, without any deviation (thus, the tracking error will be equal to zero). In order to design the policy rules, we use an algorithmic linear feedback control technique known as (exact) model matching control. It is a completely parameterized technique allowing us to develop appropriate symbolic algorithms in order to design the requested policy rules. One of the main advantages of this approach is that we obtain as a solution a class of feedback policy rules; this grants the policymaker the ability to choose the most appropriate policy rule from the set of potential policies available, depending on the particular case at hand. Moreover, the policy rules take into account the state of the economy, since they incorporate the relevant information available up to the decision period, and they are responsive (i.e., the coefficients of the algebraic expressions are not fixed), thus representing a more discretionary approach to the design of fiscal policy. Our analysis is conducted in the context of a linear, deterministic variant of the standard multiplier–accelerator model proposed by Samuelson (1939). The main reason for choosing this simple linear model is its tractability, as it will allow us to thoroughly examine the effects of the proposed methodology on the workings of the system. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the model, in Sect. 3 we develop the proposed methodology, and Sect. 4 contains some simulations and the main results of the paper. Section 5 concludes.",3

Since Solow (1956), the tentative answer has been differences in capital accumulation and technical change, but this was unsatisfactory since the theory failed to explain what accounts for these differences. Endogenous growth theories (Aghion and Howit 1992; Grossman and Helpman 1991; Romer 1990) emerged to answer the faithful call and argue that differences in research and development and human capital lead to differential growth in technical change and accumulation. Still, why do some countries invest more in education and innovation? North (1990), Acemoglu and Robinson (2013) and other new institutional economists contend that differences in institutions can explain the differences in economic performance across time and space. Institutionalists posit that economic growth is a function of economic and political institutions. This article argues that new institutionalists are guilty of the same sin committed by early growth theorists. The latter have overlooked the role of institutions in the growth process, and new institutional economists ignore the role of economic structures in the dynamics of growth. In our view, it is not institutions that cause growth; rather, it is a country’s economic structure that is the fundamental cause of economic performance. Therefore, differences in economic structures across time and space can explain the differences in economic development. This paper presents a new theoretical framework that explains how economic structures matter for growth and this is supported by a US case study. But what are economic structures? Some commodities like high-technology manufacturing possess the scope for increasing returns, and others like bananas are notorious for demonstrating diminishing returns. A given country has an increasing returns productive structure if it produces high value added commodities that are technically sophisticated and the reverse holds—a decreasing returns economic structure is composed of low value added commodities that are technologically simple. Fundamentally, economic activities reflect an economy’s productive capabilities and a country’s productive structure is simply the aggregate representation of its technological capabilities. Robust growth is realized when a country acquires an increasing returns economic structure, while economic stagnation and sporadic growth are observed otherwise. The article illustrates why increasing returns economic activities are growth enhancing. High value added and technologically complex goods are produced in market structures that are conducive for innovation (Nelson and Winter 1990; Schumpeter 2008) and these sustain higher wages and profits for longer periods (Reinert 2008). Also, increasing returns economic activities provide longer career ladders and these serve as an important means for labour to climb the ladders across social classes, which improves the distribution of income. The emerging consensus is that lower inequality is growth intensive (Stiglitz 2013, 2015b; Norris-Dabla et al. 2015; Ostry et al. 2014; Cingano 2014). Further, democratic transitions are more likely in increasing returns production structures and this enhances the diffusion of technical knowledge (Acemoglu 2008), which is an important proximate cause of growth. How can a country acquire an increasing returns economic structure? Growth-enhancing structural changes are observed when institutions of production are adequately enforced by the state (Khan 2010). Following Reinert (2007), our theoretical framework makes the distinction between institutions of production (industrial polices: tariffs, subsidies, etc.,) and institutions of exchange (property rights, rule of law, etc.,). It is obvious that without some minimal rule of law and some form of property ownership production will not be undertaken. It follows that institutions of exchange have non-trivial effects on production. However, institutions of exchange do not guarantee production or the production of goods with increasing returns. Institutions of exchange are at best necessary conditions but insufficient alone to generate production. Government subsidies and tax breaks when applied appropriately can have direct effects on production levels and incentivize the production of certain goods over others. This distinction allows us to highlight the analytical limitations of new institutional economics, particularly the work of Acemoglu et al. (2005) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2013). These scholars make the distinction between “extractive” and “inclusive” institutions. The former refers to non-democratic political institutions on the one hand and weak rule of law and the absence of private property rights on the other. It follows that “inclusive” institutions are a web of democratic political institutions, strong rule of law and the protection of private property for a broad cross section of society. The dominant discourse on institutions contends that “inclusive” institutions are the deep determinants of long-run growth. This paper posits that both “inclusive” and “extractive” institutions focus primarily on institutions of exchange. The preoccupation with the latter is the outcome of the implied assumption that production capabilities already exist. But poor countries, which by definition lack production technologies, cannot ignite robust growth by “downloading” institutions of exchange from developed countries. Indeed, resources are poorly allocated in less developed countries, but imperfect exchange becomes less of a problem when one realizes that poor countries have little to exchange. We argue that institutions of exchange cannot produce growth-enhancing structural transformations. This is the principal difference between our view and the dominant discourse on institutions and development. A key insight from our framework is that the performance of institutions is determined by a country’s economic structure. Many less developed countries have some form of “inclusive” institutions—the primary problem is that these are only written in law and hardly or only selectively enforced. This article argues that this is the outcome of decreasing returns production structures. Enforcing institutions are not costless, and diminishing returns economic activities simply do not produce sufficient value added to cover the costs of enforcement. The reverse is true in rich countries with increasing returns economic structures. Finally, our theoretical framework demonstrates how production structures affect the labour market or more concretely, the allocation of talent. A given economic structure has a given allocation of occupational rents, by this we mean the income earned by key players well above what their entrepreneurial talent justifies. The paper argues that occupational rents become an important source of de facto political power, and this in turn is used to reinforce the economic structure to preserve the distribution of occupational rents. This creates an equilibrium among political power, institutions and economic structures and explains why growth-enhancing structural change is the exception rather than the rule. The article uses the USA as a case study to provide empirical support for our theory. The case study reveals an alternative interpretation of the recent financial crisis. While many of the prominent analyses (Eggertsson and Krugman 2012; Krugman 2009; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009) focus on poor financial regulation, liquidity traps, etc., this paper argues that the housing bubble emerged as a means to paper over the deflationary tendencies of the structural transformation away from manufacturing. One important source of the deflationary tendencies is the rise of inequality. It follows that financial crises and rising inequality are likely during unmanaged structural changes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical framework, and Sect. 3 provides empirical support for our theory followed by a brief discussion. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",34

Navarrete,Virgillio M. Tatlonghari,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Japan has been one of the largest trading partners of the Philippines. In February 2004, the Philippines and Japan started negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement known as the Japan–Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA). Under the agreement which was eventually signed in September 2006, 66% of the current 5968 tariff lines were immediately eliminated and the remaining 32% were to progressively reduce. The agreement also included the accord for national treatment of investors as well as the most-favored-nation. The elimination of tariffs was expected to increase trade between the two countries. The national treatment accord gave Japanese investors the same treatment as Filipino investors in the Philippines and vice versa in Japan. These two (2) main pillars together with other provisions were expected to enhance mutually beneficial economic activities between the two countries. It has been more than 10 years since the signing of the agreement and no empirical analysis has been done to assess the overall performance of the economic partnership. Based on the data from UN COMTRADE statistics, exports of the Philippines to Japan increased by 24% in 2010, 2 years after implementation of the agreement. While many studies analyze the impact of trade on bilateral agreements using the standard Gravity model, many of its limitations can still be improved. Also, the elimination of different tariff lines with varying reduction cannot be taken into account in the standard Gravity model. Since the agreement has several economic and non-economic components, this paper will limit itself only on the economic impact to trade volume between the two countries before and after the implementation of JPEPA. Therefore, socio-cultural dimensions of the Agreement will not be dealt with. The impact of other free trade agreements entered into by Japan and the Philippines with other countries will be outside the ambit of this paper and will instead focus only on their bilateral trade. An important economic dimension of the agreement which this paper hopes to unravel would be the possible increase, if any, in foreign direct investments of Japan to the Philippines as well as in the improvement of the Philippine trade balance with Japan.",4

Daya and Authar (2012) integrated the narratives of 12 women members of the Heiveld, a rooibos (herbal tea) producer cooperative in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, to discern that human development is central to alternative economies. Subalterns, who for ages have been exploited by hegemonic forces, often create their own alternative economy (McCormack 1981) by manipulating social networks built out of a bonding named “subaltern solidarity” (Ortner 1995). Activism is often a means to social recognition (Reysen and Hackett 2017). Subalterns constitute the large majority of the members of any social system and are closely associated with the geopolitics of any geographical area (Sharp 2011). Grandia (2009) suggested that subalterns play an important role in catalysing social change through their business endeavours. The term “subaltern”, coined from Antonio Gramsci’s (1971) writings, refers to subordination in terms of class, caste, culture, gender, race, and language and was used to signify the importance of dominant/dominated relationships in antiquity. However, subalternity may not be restricted to class relations and rather is comprised of exclusion, domination, and marginality in their numerous forms (Green 2011; Perkins 2011). In a sense, groups and individuals marginalized by social and economic hegemony have been conceived as “subalterns” (Spivak 2000, p. 325). In the context of the present study, “subalterns” have been defined as the people who are uneducated farm labourers in their villages. Subalterns have also been referred to as the “humble classes”, meaning peasants, artisans, servants, villagers, and so on (Green 2002). In this context, we may ascribe to the term “hegemony”, which implies that a given group becomes more dominant and powerful in terms of social and economic position and try to dictate the conditions for the others. Subalterns often participate in alternative economic arrangement that is known as “alternative economy” (North 2010). A variety of phenomena have been found to be related to that concept (Bianchi and Birtwistle 2010). A comprehensive definition of alternative economy was provided by Haase et al. (2017, p. 1) as follows: “an economy within which actors (1) strive to avoid the effects of economic value creation that harm society or nature, (2) reject the separation of the social and economic spheres, (3) perceive and accept their responsibility for their social and economic activities and the consequences of these activities in the social and natural realms, and (4) attempt to engage in new or revitalized forms of socio-economic practice”. An inclusive definition of alternative/community economy was provided by Homer (2017), “A community economy, sometimes also known as an alternative community economy, is a type of diverse economy that prioritizes community and environmental well-being, often attempting to reduce global and national dependencies”. Campana et al. (2017) highlighted the potentially transformative role of alternative economies. A territorially self-reliant economy results in less pollution and resource depletion, which increases the benefits of community building, development of local and locally oriented social and human capital, ecosystem restoration, and the consequent improved quality of life (Combes et al. 2018; Curtis 2003). Consequently, an understanding of the alternative economies is critical to understanding the prospects of the world’s poorest (Storr and Butkevich 2007). The character of material/social relations is often entangled with the geographies where subalterns operate (Featherstone 2004). Such a contention indicates the academic need for research in the field of subaltern traders, who are subaltern entrepreneurs, specifically in developing economies. Spivak’s (1992, p. 46) appealed to “let the subaltern speak”, highlighting the need for further research on subalterns. While research on alternative economy and on subalterns has been progressing simultaneously, the overlap of these two concepts has been rare. North and Huber (2004) suggested that the characteristics of subaltern entrepreneurs often overlap with those of businesses operating in alternative economy. The forms of transactions conducted by subalterns often fall in the realm of alternative economy (North 2016). A usually less visible function of social movements, which reach out to subalterns, is to provide alternative spaces where the sense of powerlessness may be counteracted (Cassegård 2012). In developing economies, subalterns comprise of a relatively large portion of the total population, and “subaltern economic networks and social environments (SENSEs)” play a pivotal role in the sustenance of subaltern livelihoods (Varman and Vikas 2007). Thus, policymakers, scholars, and economic entities may need to be cognizant of the importance of these networks and the reasons thereof. Consequently, it seems pertinent to study the characteristics of alternative economies that are applicable to the businesses run by subalterns. A subaltern business group is identified in the present study, and the applicability of the characteristics of alternative economies is researched. The objective of the present study, therefore, is to explore the overlapping space of subaltern business groups and alternative economy. The present study embraces the following steps: (a) tracing the evolution of alternative economy with a view to understanding the characteristics of alternative economy; (b) identifying some distinctive characteristics of alternative economic networks; and (c) utilizing the distinctive characteristics of alternative economic networks, to conduct a qualitative study of an organization of subaltern street peddlers. The narratives collected from the subaltern peddlers are used to present certain inferences about the nature of the overlapping space of alternative economy and subaltern businesses. A conceptual framework is constructed for this overlapping space based upon the results of the present study. Such a conceptual framework of the overlapping space of alternative economy and subalterns may add certain important aspects to the simultaneously burgeoning body of academic works on alternative economy as well as subaltern studies. Scholars and policymakers may be able to understand the alternative economic networks of subalterns better and may suggest policies for the sustenance of such networks.",1

In the aftermath of Iran–Iraq war, the government of Iran found itself with a substantial disruption of supplied chains caused by the freezing of the country’s foreign assets, the destructive 8-year war with Iraq (1980–1988) and economic sanctions (Pesaran 1995; Amuzegar 2000; Valadkhani 2001). In the face of such intense challenges, the government was forced to spend billions of dollars to compensate for the destruction of production capacity and infrastructure. The result of these policies, as argued by Pesaran (2000), ‘had been an economy in a state of acute disequilibrium with highly distorted price signals’. These economic conditions together with the absence of a strong private sector may help explain the government’s role in the economy. After the 1979 revolution, the government began the nationalization process.Footnote 1 The result of this policy was the formation of a high degree of government ownership and its associated institutional incentives which prohibited the private sector from participating in the financing, construction, operation and maintenance of public infrastructure. Since then, the government has actively involved in a variety of investment projects aimed at meeting the country’s identified needs such as education, electricity and water utilities, medical care, transportation and waste disposal. As a resource-rich country, Iran’s economic performance has been largely driven by oil and gas revenues. The windfall income from natural resources creates fertile ground for rent-seeking activities (Farhadi et al. 2015). It is worth noting that the share of oil revenue in GDP declined from 9% in 1990 to 6% in 2015, while the share of tax revenue in GDP marginally increased from 4.5% in 1990 to 6% in 2015. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the decline in oil revenue may tie the government’s hands to some extent. We therefore expect the government to make viable investment decisions and to become more accountable to the public. It is important to emphasize at this point that, in the case of Iran, the government participation in investment projects is most likely to be prone to X-inefficiency. According to the monitoring report of the Iranian Planning and Budget Organization for 2014, the expected life of a new public project is around 2.8 years, while the weighted average of a completed project is 12.7 years.Footnote 2 This gap is associated with a mass of unfinished projects which has weakened the financial ability of the Iranian government to meet its objectives efficiently. Given the increasing importance of cost–benefit analysis for public investment decisions, the choice of a proper social discount rate is a crucial issue. The social discount rate is an established measure of a society’s preference for present consumption versus future consumption. In other words, it reflects the extent to which a society is willing to give up a unit of consumption now in return for more consumption later. Zhuang et al. (2007) argue that when dealing with very long-lived projects, the choice of the social discount rate should not only consider economic efficiency, but also intergenerational equity. Itoh (2016) points out that implementation of cost–benefit analysis has significant implications for the financial evaluation of economic sectors. This is particularly important for policymakers in the government decision-making process to ensure significant and long-term benefits for the country. To this end, the rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 will explain and justify the social time preference rate method. In Sect. 3, we will present the data and methodology. The empirical analysis and the derivation of the social discount rate will be displayed in Sect. 4. Section 5 will highlight our conclusions.",8

The GDP growth rate has reached 12.5% in 1972 to drop 58% in 1976 with the beginning of the Lebanese civil war, to increase by 83% at the end of 1990. However, starting the after-war reconstruction in 1997, the real GDP growth rate has oscillated over the period 1999–2015, from below 0% level in 1999 to 2.57% in 2009 (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, since 1992, the Lebanese economy was characterized by a high level of dollarization as a consequence of hyperinflation. To control the inflation rate, the Lebanese monetary authorities have adopted the fixed exchange rate regime in 1997 administrating the Lebanese currency price. Thus, to maintain the Lebanese currency parity against the dollar within a very narrow limit, the Central Bank offered high interest rates on Lebanese treasury bills. The cost of fixing the Lebanese currency added to the cost of reconstruction after the civil war, and the Israeli continual attacks to south Lebanon have produced a permanent budget deficit and contributed to increase the public debts to alarming level. The public debts GDP ratio is equivalent to 185% in 2015. What causes GDP fluctuations? The Keynesian view line theoreticians advocated the role of monetary and argued that short-run fluctuations in employment and output are largely caused by variations in aggregate demand. However, Lucas (1972, 1977) pointed to the shortcoming of the Keynesian approach and provides a theoretical groundwork for the notion of “monetary policy ineffectiveness” by integrating the rational expectations to the economic model. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) postulated a link between monetary policy and real economic activity. Consequently, the monetarist leaders explained that monetary authorities should prevent excessive expansion of the money supply to maintain price stability. The aim of this paper is to identify the Lebanese business cycle over the period 1998–2015 and to explore how aggregate activity in Lebanon fluctuates with recurrent shocks. In other terms, this paper investigates how the output fluctuates around the trend level that reflects the business cycles amplitude and duration. Moreover, this paper discusses whether the adopted monetary policy in Lebanon had succeeded to smooth the business cycles or not? The assessment of the causality relation between the capacity utilization rate and inflation allows to answer whether monetary disturbances matter for business cycle. As in Cogley and Nason (1995), this paper uses Hodrick Prescott filter to identify Lebanese business cycle. However, Granger causality test is used to evaluate the relationship between the capacity utilization rate and the inflation in the short run, while OLS method is applied to assess this relation in the long run. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the empirical literature review. Section 3 presents the Hodrick Prescott Filter results and analysis for the Lebanese GDP followed in Sect. 4 by an analysis to the relationship between the capacity utilization rate and inflation variables to conclude in Sect. 5. All the tests are performed using EViews.",

As the need for accurate accounting for material flows became evident in the 1990s, PIOTs were conceived of as a way of integrating the strengths of Input–Output (IO) modeling with material flow analysis (MFA). The PIOT structure is derived from Economic Input–Output (EIO) models, but intersectoral flows are captured in physical units rather than monetary units. The first PIOTs were developed in the 1990s (Gravgaard-Pedersen 1999; Konijn et al. 1997; Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006; Hoekstra 2010) and demonstrated the utility of PIOTs as a tool for analyzing the physical interdependency between economic sectors as well as the interactions of the economy with the environment. While several researchers have highlighted the potential for PIOTs for material tracking and benefits of inclusion of more IO data in physical units (Altimiras-Martin 2014; Hubacek and Giljum 2003; Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006; Duchin and Levine 2011; Merciai and Heijungs 2014), their adoption and development have lagged compared to material flow analysis (MFA) (Hoekstra 2010), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Environmentally Extended Input–Output (EEIO) analysis. The slow adoption of PIOTs is attributed to high compilation costs, lack of physical data at the appropriate aggregation levels, lack of reproducibility and continuity in available datasets along with limited applications demonstrating the use of PIOT (Hoekstra 2010). However, the limited applications are a consequence of the limited number of PIOTs available leading to a negative feedback cycle of lag in PIOT development. An early use of PIOTs for measuring the ecological footprint of trade was noted by Hubacek and Giljum (Hubacek and Giljum 2003). PIOTs provide unique insights into the physical structure of the economy (Altimiras-Martin 2014), which differs from the economic structure since monetary input–output tables (MIOTs) record the flows of goods and services according to their economic values, not their physical mass (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006). Thus, PIOTs can also provide insights toward a transparent transition to the circular economy. Recent emphasis on the food–energy–water nexus further highlights the need to integrate physical data with consumption patterns at a subnational level, which PIOTs are uniquely suited to do (Wachs and Singh 2017). Additionally, elemental cycles in the economy using PIOTs (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006) are important for studies of dematerialization and movements of critical materials. In this vein, Singh et al. have created a first regional PIOT to demonstrate the nitrogen (N) cycle in the economy of Illinois due to the important role of N in food and energy provision and its significant environmental impacts such as eutrophication (Singh et al. 2017). Physical transaction matrices for sectors with material outputs provide the best basis for future projections (Weisz and Duchin 2006). Furthermore, the incorporation of flows to nature, intrinsic to PIOTs, is key for environmental analysis regarding waste management (Dietzenbacher et al. 2009). Therefore, interest in developing PIOTs has continued (despite the lack of a standardized approach) and multiple PIOTs have been developed using empirical or IO-based approaches as follows. Currently, four approaches exist that can facilitate the construction of PIOTs or mixed unit IO tables: unit physical input–output by materials (UPIOM) (Nakamura et al. 2011), the approach for developing hybrid supply and use tables (HSUTs) in EXIOBASE (Merciai and Schmidt 2018), hybrid LCA/IO approaches (Lindner and Guan 2014) and an RAS-based approach (Fry et al. 2016). In UPIOM, a highly disaggregated MIOT is used to derive the unit structure, that is, a binary matrix for each sector depicting whether or not it is related by intersectoral flows to other sectors. Another binary matrix shows whether the monetary relationship corresponds to a physical relationship. A yield matrix indicates the proportion of the starting material that becomes product versus waste. The transformed matrix is then classified into resources, materials and products. (In their terminology, resources are used to produce materials which in turn are used to make products.) In the USA, UPIOM has been employed to study metals at a detailed national level (Chen et al. 2016; Nuss et al. 2016). Recently, UPIOM was integrated into the pioneering work in building HSUTs for EXIOBASE (Merciai and Schmidt 2018). In this approach, rather than calculating technical coefficients exclusively from existing monetary IO tables and converting via price, coefficients are primarily taken from life cycle inventory (LCI) data and literature, thus overcoming the need for highly disaggregated MIOTs as a basis. Yield factors (called transfer or transformation coefficients) specific to each material and total materials are calculated. An initial estimate of supply and use tables (SUTs) is generated by a multistep approach involving empirical data, the technical and yield coefficients, minimum material requirements and a trade module to estimate sufficient supply. These SUTs are then constrained to ensure mass balance when technical and transformation coefficients are readjusted. The trade module uses this information to build the multiregional HSUTs. This method is comprehensive, however depends on the quality of data available from LCIs which in turn face challenges of validation, representativeness and future adaptation for changing technologies. Another common approach for building PIOTs incorporates LCA data for individual sectors, similar to the tiered hybrid LCA approach (Crawford et al. 2018; Suh et al. 2004), where a subset of sectors is modeled with LCA and EIO data fills in for the rest. Nevertheless, the LCA data in physical units are often used to generate a new IOT in the IO-based hybrid LCA method (Malik et al. 2014; Wolfram et al. 2016; Teh et al. 2017). This approach offers good precision, validation, and comprehensive mass flows and environmental impacts. Yet, the opacity of the LCA datasets limits reproducibility, continuity and usefulness in long-term decision-making. A final approach has recently been adopted in Australia to create a time series of PIOTs (Fry et al. 2016), using a variety of approximation techniques to fill in data gaps, notably a RAS technique applied sequentially. It requires a strong initial basis for the data tables, which is not yet available at the subnational level, thereby limiting the application of this approach. While significant advances have been made toward PIOT compilation methodologies, existing challenges for adoption of these methods include: lack of disaggregated IO tables for UPIOM approach, coverage gaps and opacity in LCA datasets, LCI data quality challenges (unmet thermodynamic balances) and limited updates. Gaps for subnational PIOT construction are even larger. Thus, a critical need remains for methods that allow reproducibility, transparency and continuity, so that PIOTs can be widely utilized in decision-making. This was also alluded to in work on the future of IO analysis, where Dietzenbacher hypothesized a world MRIO in physical units, linked to engineering and GIS data (Dietzenbacher et al. 2013). The main contribution of this paper is in proposing a bottom-up approach for constructing PIOTs that combine the strength of process engineering models with the IO framework. This approach is suitable for automation and allows for continuity of datasets at multiple scales to rapidly generate PIOTs. This method can also be integrated with existing approaches to improve process data used in technical coefficients. Since, the method utilizes a detailed technology model, PIOTs created with this method can be updated faster to reflect technology changes in the economy as envisioned by the rectangular choice-of-technology (RCOT) method (Duchin and Levine 2011). Specifically, the proposed method brings the following advantages over the process LCA-based PIOT generation: (1) Process modeling is a transparent methodology where model parameters and unit operations can be seen and adjusted, allowing easy updates and automation; (2) process modeling via the software (Aspen Plus) used here respects the laws of thermodynamics, a challenge in life cycle inventories that needs correction such as via data reconciliation (Yi and Bakshi 2007; Singh et al. 2008; Hau et al. 2008), which is rarely done and (3) process models detail the mechanisms of transformation occurring in each operation of a production system, rather than relying only on empirical documentation for coefficient calculation. Since process model results are used here mainly to generate technical and yield coefficients, this approach can be integrated with comprehensive methodologies such as UPIOM and EXIOBASE, and may allow for improvements in the databases used for calculating physical transactions matrices in existing approaches. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the proposed methodology. Section 3 demonstrates the methodology to generate a 6-sector nitrogen PIOT for Illinois. In Sect. 4, we compare the PIOT generated in this work with a previously developed N PIOT (Singh et al. 2017) as a validation of the proposed approach along with discussing advantages, challenges and limitations of the approach. Section 5 concludes and details opportunities for future work and standardization of PIOT development.",9

This is even more so when it is verified that there has been a reduction in economic growth rates,Footnote 1 such as from 2001 to 2010 when, on average, this rate was 3.48% per year, and the most recent period, from 2011 to 2014, when it reached 1.79% per year, according to IBGE (2017). Indeed, according to Feenstra et al. (2015), the total factor productivity in Brazil from 1950 to 2014, considering information from the Penn World Table (PWT), achieved an average growth rate of 3.58% per year.Footnote 2 According to De Negri and Cavalcante (2014), investment did not have enough impact to stimulate the Brazilian economy in the long term, given its resilience. In addition, as stated by Squeff and De Negri (2014), Brazilian productive efficiency has had a poor performance since the 1980s, aside from some growth in early 2000s.Footnote 3 According to Nogueira et al. (2014), this growth was sustained by higher productivity growth in agriculture. Thus, in order for productivity to contribute to sustainable Brazilian growth in the long term, it would first have to be improved. In Brazil, there are several studies on aggregate productivity (Barbosa-Filho et al. 2010; Bonelli and Veloso 2012; Bonelli and Bacha 2013; Ferreira and Veloso 2013). In turn, the sectoral approach is also present in the national literature (Squeff and De Negri 2014; Nogueira et al. 2014; Matteo 2015), but according to Ellery Jr. (2014), disaggregated productivity has many obstacles, such as a lack of information. In this context, this paper seeks to contribute to the discussion on the subject by measuring total factor productivity in a disaggregated way, considering the sector (agriculture, industry, and services) and the region (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Center-West) jointly in the country from 2004 to 2014.Footnote 4 The analysis helps to verify which regions and sectors were responsible for contributing to the low aggregate performance. In addition, it also sought to verify the impact that the growth rate of these productivities had on economic growth through the growth decomposition, verifying whether the growth trend was the same for both. Finally, having verified productivity’s behavior by sector and region, it is still worth adopting measures for comparing the results of calculating total factor productivity (TFP). Therefore, to allow a comparison of the results, productivity was also estimated by econometric methods, namely pooled panel data, fixed effects panels, a dynamic panel in level, and differences. This analysis allows for clarifying questions about whether the measure of TFP represents reality.",2

The purpose of this environmental conservation program is not only to make ecological conservation efforts, but it also aims to promote the economic development in poor rural inland China. Several researchers have discussed the impacts of the GTGP on rural household economic activity. Most of the results showed positive effects of the GTGP on rural economies. The effect of GTGP on China’s grain production prices or food imports is negligible. These studies focus on the impact of the GTGP on the agricultural sector and rural economy. However, neither of these studies dealt with the influences of the GTGP on the structural changes in the whole regional economy, especially its influence in various stages of policy implementation. As the long-term policy, changes in rural communities which were caused by the GTGP continuously affect the rest of the economy through the economic and employment interindustrial linkage, in particular, in regions which agriculture is the key sector of the local economy and the participation is high. These impacts are regionally specified and depend on local policy practices. Measurement of their impacts on the specified regional economic structural change is needed. In this paper, by utilizing the regional input–output model, we provide a starting point for discussion of the impacts of environmental conservation programs on the region wide economy in China. We generate agriculture-based regional input–output tables and conduct the ex-post policy evaluations for the structural changes in Guizhou Province, China, from 2002 to 2012. The agricultural sector is a key sector in this west inland province. Over 70% of the local population was living by farming before the policy implementation, and their income is the lowest in China. The participation of the GTGP and the related Environmental Migration Program (EMP) in this province is high; about 10% of cropland was converted to forest or grassland in this region. The structure of the paper is as follows. The environmental conservation programs are explained in the next section. The third section describes their implementation in the study area and construction of agriculture-based regional input–output tables. In the fourth section, an overview of input–output models is provided, explaining what can be measured using the input–output method. The fifth section explains the analysis results. Then, we summarize the conclusion and discuss some limitations and precaution that need to be taken when applying input–output techniques for this research. The Grain to Green Program was enacted by the State Forestry Administration of China in 1999 and aims to increase vegetation covered areas by converting steep slope cropland into forest or grassland. The government pays farmers participated in the GTGP for taking cropland afforestation practices. The GTGP should increase vegetative cover by 32 million ha by 2010 in China (Liu et al. 2008). The Chinese central government also aims to promote rural development in its poor inland area by implementing the GTGP. In 2002, 25 provincial regions enrolled in this program, and 120 million farmers in 30 million households were involved. These provinces have agriculture-based backward economies, and most of the local populations are living by farming. Local farmer participated in the GTGP receives more subsidies while they use less labor and energy for unprofitable agricultural production (Oniki et al. 2007). The subsidies of the GTGP are supported by the central government. They should not affect the budget of the local government and are supposed to mitigate the income gap between developed coastal area and underdeveloped inland area. The Environmental Migration Program (EMP) was accompanied with the GTGP and was initiated in 2000 in 12 of the 25 provinces enrolled in the GTGP. Participants of the EMP receive subsidies for moving away from environmentally fragile areas to be conserved and resettled in ecologically sustainable rural or urban areas. Most of the estimation for the economic impact of the GTGP showed it has impacts on the increase in rural household income and shifting of rural production activities (Uchida et al. 2005, 2007, 2009; Wang et al. 2007; Wang and Maclaren 2012; Liu et al. 2010). Regional difference in income improvement has been found in policy implementation (Uchida et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2010). Some evidence indicates that GTGP has intensified the income inequality between farmer participated and not participated in the GTGP (Li et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2004). The effect of the GTGP on agricultural production and grain products has been studied as well. The results of Feng et al. (2005) suggest the GTGP might not have a major impact on China’s future grain supply and the world grain market. Xu et al. (2006) reveal that agricultural production and grain price can be adjusted by the market. Thus, the GTGP has only a small effect on China’s grain production and almost no effect on prices or food imports. Neither of these studies dealt with the indirect impact of the GTGP on the overall regional economy. As a long-term policy, the GTGP and the EMP have repercussive impacts on the rest of the economy through demand–supply and employment linkages. Also, these impacts are highly dependent upon the actual level of program participation, the level of agricultural production regulation achieved, the expenditures generated by the subsidies and the local economy’s ability to adapt to changes in the local expenditure patterns. The evaluation of the impact of the GTGP on the regional economy is needed. This study addresses this concern by investigating the regional economic structural change under the GTGP and the EMP implemented in various stages. The study area Guizhou is a south-west inland province in China. This region covers 17.6 million ha. The estimated population is 38 million in 2002 (NBSC 2002), as the GTGP has been formally launched in this province. This region was chosen because participation in the GTGP and the EMP is high. About two million of rural households participated in the GTGP. Approximately 0.44 million ha cropland which accounts for 10% of the regional cropland area was converted (Finance Bureau of Guizhou 2012). The Guizhou economy largely depends on the primitive agricultural sector. Almost all farmers in Guizhou are small householders. Over 60% of the employment is in the farm sector. Rural household income in Guizhou is the lowest in China. Crop and livestock production accounted for 12% of the total gross output in Guizhou in 2002. Guizhou government released three benchmark IO tables of 2002, 2007 and 2012, which presents at current prices. In this paper, we aggregate non-agricultural sectors to make consistent and comparable IO tables among three time points, because the coverage of non-agriculture sectors changed in different years, unlike the agricultural sector.Footnote 1 The current price IO tables are converted to constant price tables by using price deflators and the double-deflation method. The price deflators are constructed following Sasaki and Ueyama (2009) (see Appendix 1). The sectoral employment requirement is calculated according to the statistical yearbook of Guizhou and the data from the original IO tables. The methods for estimating the labor requirement in each sector are given as the additional dataset (see Appendix 2) in IO tables. In the reaggregated agriculture-based Guizhou IO tables (see Table 1), final demand consists of goods and services purchased by investments, government purchases, purchases made by outside consumers (exports) and purchases made by household consumers. Rural and urban household consumption is calculated separately for investigating the impact of subsidies on the rural household expenditure. The outside consumers (export) include abroad buyer and buyer from other provinces. The outside suppliers (import) included abroad one and domestic neighbor as well. The implementation of the environmental conservation program in Guizhou from 2002 to 2007 and 2007 to 2012 is significantly different. Farmer received grain subsidies and seedling for cropland afforestation before 2008. Almost all the afforestation practices finished between 2002 and 2007. From 2007 to 2012, cropland conversion stopped. Subsidies from the central government were paid to the farmer in cash form instead of grain form until all the contraction of the GTGP expired (in 2016). In 2010, the local government began to promote a new EMP plan actively. Subsidies of the EMP are mainly used for resettlement practices. The economic impact of land retirement and environmental conservation programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the USA has been widely estimated by utilizing IO analytical framework (Mortensen et al. 1990; Hyberg et al. 1991; Siegel and Johnson 1993; Leistritz 1998; Skaggs et al. 1994). The studies of the economic impact of CRP found negative impacts on both the production, employment and earning in the crop sector and its related upstream and downstream industries. Because of the rapid economic growth, evaluation of the economic impact of the GTGP and the EMP on the regional economy in China needs further consideration to distinguish their influences under dynamic condition. The Leontief demand-driven model establishes a relationship between output X and final consumption F by a fixed proportion of inputs. It shows economic impacts can be measured regarding the changes in sectoral gross output resulting from changes in final sectoral demand. In regional IO analysis, with the concern of the interregional input and output, we construct the revised Leontief demand-driven model. Denote A as the matrix of input coefficients \(A = \{ a_{i,j} \} = x_{i,j} /x_{j}\). The final demand F includes local final demand Y and export (outflow) E. The import M should be subtracted from the total domestic demand; then, the balance equation between intermediate demand AX, final demand F, import (inflow) M and gross output X is: In the most practical case, import M is proportional to total demand. In “competing import type” IO table, import is a column vector and proportional to total demand. We define import coefficients as \(\varvec{m}_{i} = \frac{{m_{i} }}{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{j} a_{i,j} x_{i} + y_{i} }}\) (assuming no import or inflow is redirected for export or outflow). Putting \(\varvec{m}_{i}\) as diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix \(\hat{M} = \begin{array}{*{20}c} {\varvec{m}_{1} } & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & \ldots & {\varvec{m}_{i} } \\ \end{array}\) and substituting \(\hat{M}\) into Eq. (1), Eq. (1) can be transferred as Solving Eq. (2) on X, the following balance equation can be derived. We denote the Leontief inverse matrix as \(\varvec{B} = \{ b_{ij} \} = [I - (I - \hat{M})A]^{ - 1}\). Under the Hawkins–Simon condition, the induced production value that derives from each domestic final demand item is presented as Here, k represents the domestic local demand item (government expenditure, investment and household consumption). Foreign and interregional purchase is exogenous to the local production process. Specifically, the induced production value by export E is expressed as follows: By multiplying value-added coefficients with production inducement, we get gross value-added inducement. Denote V = {vj} as a vector of gross value added, and the gross value-added coefficient is \(\varvec{v}_{j} = \frac{{{\text{v}}_{j} }}{{x_{j} }}\). Putting \(\varvec{v}_{j}\) as diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix \(\hat{\varvec{v}} = \begin{array}{*{20}c} {\varvec{v}_{1} } & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & \ldots & {\varvec{v}_{j} } \\ \end{array}\) and substituting B and \(\hat{\varvec{v}}\) into Eq. (3), there is: The employment inducement is calculated by multiplying of employment coefficients as: Denoting \(\varvec{C} = \hat{\varvec{l}}\varvec{B} = [c_{i,j} ]\), \(\bar{C}\) is the arithmetic mean of \(\varvec{C}\). The employment influence coefficients are presented as \(\frac{{C_{j} }}{{\bar{C}}}\). The employment sensitivity coefficient is presented as \(\frac{{C_{i} }}{{\bar{C}}}\). During different stages, the proportion of productions are not fixed, and the technique coefficient changed. In this research, we compare the inducement changes by final demand items at different time points, and the technological changes are included. The technological changes in Guizhou economy are discussed by the linkage and RAS analysis. The backward and forward linkage analysis was constructed to figure out the key sector in the economy. Industries have effects on the whole economy through their demand and supply relations with other industries. This demand and supply dependencies are called the backward and forward linkage, respectively. Generally, the backward linkage is derived from the Leontief model (Jones 1976; Cella 1984; Miller and Blair 2009). Leontief inverse matrix B shows the direct and indirect requirements of domestic output per unit of final demand in each sector, and it is also referred as the output multiplier. Output multiplier defines the total backward linkage as \(\varvec{b}_{j}^{t} = \mathop \sum \nolimits_{{{\text{i}} = 1}}^{n} \varvec{b}_{i,j}\). The superscript t refers to as the “total linkage” of each industry. In recent years, researchers suggest the measurement of the forward linkage from the Ghosh supply-driven IO model (Andreosso-O’Callaghan and Yue 2004; Dietzenbacher 2005; Miller and Blair 2009). The solution of Ghosh supply-driven model is written as In Eq. (8), \(X^{\prime }\) is the reverse matrix of total input, and \(V^{\prime }\) is the reverse matrix of gross value added. Matrix D is the output coefficients matrix. Denoting \(\varvec{F} = [I - D]^{ - 1} = \{ \varvec{g}_{i,j} \}\) as the Ghosh inverse matrix, the row sum of elements in F is referred as the input multiplier. It defines the total forward linkage as \(\varvec{f}_{i}^{t} = \mathop \sum \nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} \varvec{g}_{i,j}\). The total backward and forward linkages indicate only the one-side dependencies on a sector at hand and include the dependencies of this sector itself on the rest of the economy. The net backward and the net forward linkages are proposed to measure the two-sided nature of dependencies between a sector at hand and the economy at large to which it belongs (Oosterhaven 2004, 2007; Temurshoev and Oosterhaven 2014; Dietzenbacher 2005; Oosterhaven and Stelder 2002; Sonis et al. 1995). By correcting total impacts with the share of dependencies in a sector itself that is dependent on the performance of the rest of the economy, the net backward and net forward linkages are defined as, respectively, The net backward linkage equals the output generated in all industries due to the final demand of one sector normalized by the output generated in this sector due to the final demand of all industries. A key sector with net backward linkage larger than 1 implies that this sector is a net demander for the rest of the economy. The net forward linkage equals to total inputs of all industries that utilize the primary input of a sector normalized by the total input of this sector that embodies the primary inputs of all industries. A key sector with net forward linkage larger than 1 implies that this sector is a net supplier to the rest of the economy. Originally, RAS was used in the early work of Stone (1961) for prediction of the input coefficient. Deming and Stephan (1940) applied this non-survey method to update IO tables from existing IO tables. Because the RAS analytical procedure is carried out iteratively on row sums and column sums, it is also known as the proportional matrix balancing technique (Miller and Blair 2009). Kagatsume (2004, 2006) suggested that the diagonal elements of R indicate the substitution change in each sector and the diagonal elements of S indicate the processing change in each sector. The substitution and processing effect change can be used to indicate a change of interstage input and output coefficient for each industrial sector. In RAS analysis, R refers to a diagonal matrix of elements that modify rows. A is the coefficient matrix to be modified, and S refers to a diagonal matrix of column modifiers. This method can be shown in the following matrix form: In Eq. (10), matrix A in right-hand side is the original input coefficient matrix in the base year T and matrix A′ in the left-hand side is the coefficient matrix in the predicted year (T + m). By solving the equation with the RAS method, matrices R and S are derived. Matrix R is a row-wise correction matrix of the original input coefficient matrix A and indicates the substitution effect. Similarly, matrix S is the column-wise correction matrix of A and indicates the processing degree change known as the fabrication effect. The substitution and fabrication factors are computed using the iterative RAS procedure. Substitution effect factors represent the rate of increase in intermediate demand for sector i from all sectors. The fabrication effect factors represent the rate of increase in intermediate input to sector i from all sectors. Thus, the sectors with the combination of the diagonal elements in R larger than one and those in S smaller than one can be considered as the more promising sector in the next period, which means this sector is a potentially growing sector. Moreover, the sectors with the combination of diagonal elements in R less than one and those in S greater than one can be considered as a less promising sector, which means this sector is a potentially declining sector.",1

Life expectancy and infant mortality are major health status determinants that impact economic growth. OECD countries with higher life expectancies and low infant mortality rates have more economic development and higher standards of living than all other countries. However, unfortunately, only in recent times economists have realized that health is an important part of human capital formation sustaining economic growth and improvements in health status can be justified on purely economic grounds. Good health raises levels of human capital and this has a positive effect on individual productivity and human capital returns. Better health increases workforce productivity by reducing incapacity and the number of days lost to sick leave besides increasing the opportunities of obtaining better paid work. Although good health may be considered a form of human capital that has a beneficial effect on productivity, income also influences health in a positive way. The capacity to generate higher earnings facilitates an increase in the consumption of health-related goods such as adequate food, medicine and health care, which provide longer longevity. However, the income effects on health are not equally distributed. Wealthier people can provide higher investments in health capital although the marginal benefits are largest among the poorest. Thus, the simultaneous health–income relationship needs to be analyzed in a framework where income inequality also affects the health outcomes. In response to this, we specify a simultaneous three-equation model between level GDP per capita (GDPc), health status (HS) and health expenditures per capita (HEc) for a data set of 194 countries in years 1990–2014. GDPc and HS determinations are also affected by income inequality, i.e., we propose that income inequality effects on GDPc (level and growth) and HS are depending on the income level of country. To obtain a compact approach on health and inequality effects on GDPc, the analysis is cast in the framework of Kuznets’ hypothesis maintaining a positive income inequality relationship for poor countries contrary to the rich ones. We argue that so-called low-income high-inequality trap can be escaped in the presence of Kuznets’ hypothesis by raising the health expenditures–GDP ratio and with cost-effective health technology. The argument is that the poorest countries can quite quickly do this, if improvements in their health status and inequalities create a push effect in the growth direction. This can happen easily when negative relationship between income inequality and health status is not present. However, often inequalities, low levels of health expenditures, high unemployment, low levels of education and labor productivity and detrimental health-related behavior in non-rich countries—all slow down or even hinder this important and urgently needed catch-up. Estimation results show that Kuznets’ hypothesis is still relevant for countries with low GDPc levels, i.e., low-income high-inequality trap is still present in the poorest countries blocking the catch-up. However, the modern version of hypothesis maintaining that income inequality has negative effect on the growth of GDPc is not rejected for countries with different levels of GDPc. Generally we show that a positive bidirectional health–income relationship is not rejected and that more equal income distribution decreases infant mortality rate. The structure of paper is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 focus on the studies on health and inequality effects on economic growth. Section 4 analyzes the Kuznets’ hypothesis and gives the model to be estimated. In Sect. 5 the estimation results are given and discussed. Section 6 ends the paper with conclusion. Subsequently, appendices give the study variables with data resources, review of the relevant econometric methods and detailed estimation results.",7

The corresponding literature is characterized by strikingly contradictory viewpoints. Some authors have commented that government expenditure is almost neutrally related to aggregate output: besides the famous Harberger (1964, 2003) conjecture (Engen and Skinner 1996; Mark et al. 1997; Mendoza et al. 1997; Wasylenko 1997; Hines 2002; Xing 2011). Some studies have considered this impact negative: Mark et al. (1997), Beach (1998), Poulson and Kaplan (2008), McBride (2012), Pettinger (2017). The opinions positing the positive influence of government spending on economic growth predominate, and such a role is attributed to the so-called productive items of the public budget (Kneller et al. 1999); notably, Asimakopoulos et al. (2016) included them into their macroeconomic production function. Divergent opinions have also been formulated concerning public budget taxes. Mertens and Ravn (2013) identified immediate effects on output induced by changes in average tax rates. Engen and Skinner (1996) posited, “the tax level is likely to exert a modest, but cumulatively important, influence on long-term growth rates. (p. 36).” Structurally, many studies have outlined the unequal consequences of various taxes on output. Therefore, although taxation of income and profit, payroll and labor, property, and social security contributions would cause distortions, no such effect was identified for other taxes (Kneller et al. 1999). Concerning capital taxation, the theoretical modeling indicated a complicated sinusoidal evolution, from level zero (Judd 1985; Chamley 1986) to relatively high rates (Piketty and Saez 2013). Lee and Gordon (2005) found that the corporate tax rate is negatively correlated with economic growth, but other tax variables are not significantly associated. The variegated picture of the research conclusions on the “public budget–economic growth” tandem was described in overviews, such as Huang (2006), Kenny and Winer (2006), Afonso et al. (2008), Myles (2009), Magazzino and Forte (2010), Martinez-Vazquez et al. (2011), Magazzino (2012), McBride (2012), Nygård and Revesz (2015), Afonso and Alves (2016), Dobrescu (2016a), Winer (2016), Churchill et al. (2017), Fisman et al. (2017), and Gomez-Puig and Sosvilla-Rivero (2017). How can such interpretative diversity be explained? The epistemological premises of various studies and the real specificities of studied experiences cannot be ignored. Working on this paper, we concluded that only these circumstances are not sufficient. A significant cognitive impact arises from underestimating the temporal scale to which the examined problems refer. Or concerning government finance, the delimitation of three perspectives seems essential. The first one considers the global historical trajectory of modern society, for example, the Wagnerian hypothesis (Wagner 1883). With roots in classical economics, the anticipation that economic development will be accompanied by an increasing share of government expenditure in national income has been confirmed by authorized statistical series. Inherent parallel growth of taxation—admitted still by Wagner—was comprehensively discussed by Kaldor (1962, 1963a, b). The syntagm “Wagner–Kaldor law” is justified. Another perspective concerns the limited temporal segment, provisionally named a “given structural state–society relationship,” as a distinct component of the larger notions, such as human social environment (Barnett and Casper 2001), social capital (Field 2008), social structure in a network-based perspective (Mukherjee 2007), or a given historical context (Dobrescu 2016a). The binomial state–society is dynamic, its forms and ampleness modifying along global history and within the same social system. Such changes occur periodically, and existing intervals with sufficiently stable features include: the dominant behaviors of people as taxpayers and beneficiaries of public spending. In this paper, we shall refer exactly to these intervals. Finally, note the short–medium horizon, and the problems of such a time span being prioritary for macroeconomic policies. Keynesian and post-Keynesian models remain relevant for such intervals. In our opinion, if empirical research does not account for these temporal scales, its consistency is inevitably affected. The trap of applying or checking the theorems on improper samples of observations was unavoidable. Among such temptations, especially risky would be to relate the Wagner–Kaldor law to limited historical information or, by contrast, to expostulate the Keynesian schemes to long and very long series. Similar problems occur when PANEL analyses involve data belonging to economies in different development stages. The assertion—sometimes deduced from such studies—that data corroborate the Wagner–Kaldor law for low-income countries while rejecting it in the case of rich ones, overlooks that this law envisages the global historical trajectory of society and not its various segments. A possible disregard of the temporal scale of analysis can also be observed in model specification. The econometrics of the Wagner–Kaldor law is again edifying and intended for a relationship on very long horizon between output and ratio of government spending to gross domestic product (GDP). In its formalization, the main difficulty stems from the non-unitary evolution of the involved variables. Although the potential output registered an obvious increasing trend, the share of government expenditure in GDP cannot extend unlimitedly. At superior development stages, despite the increasing per-capita income, the social acceptability of taxation decelerates, tending toward an asymptotical level. (Normally, it is situated under unity, which is its maximum potential limit.) This trend seems to be linked to the extending capacity of the private sector to provide some public goods and services, and enforcing democratic control on government decisions. Consequently, in modeling the size of the government in relation to economic growth long term, the threshold regression methods are more suitable (Christie 2011) as well as nonlinear functions (Kuckuck 2012; Hajamini and Falahi 2014; Aghion et al. 2016), including the logistic one (Florio and Colautti 2002; Magableh 2006). In this context, notably, is the conclusion drawn by Fölster and Henrekson (2001): The relationship between government expenditure and growth is negative in rich countries. This research focused on government finance for a given structural state–society relationship in the frameworks of the second aforementioned delimited temporal scale. Under such conditions, the relative stability of three dominant social behaviors is assumed, namely: State intervention propensity, especially concerning the government spending, Tax acceptability, and Risk aversion to public indebtedness. All these conditions are sociological reactive processes [as characterized in Mahoney (2000)]. Any change in the institutional framework of public budget expenditures, taxation, or public debt evolution is followed—as a rule—by counter reactions (i.e., upback or pushback) on the side of domestic economic agents, foreign markets, civic organizations, mass media, political formations, and public opinion in general. The tendency toward equilibrium of society generates some steady-state levels of leading indicators, defining quantitatively the aforementioned behaviors: the share of public budget expenditures in GDP, degree of tax acceptability, and public debt size. Obviously, these levels are specific for each given structural state–society relationship. Admittedly, the dynamics of actual processes around the steady-state levels is submitted concomitantly—similarly to other economic dependences—to the scale efficiency and diminishing marginal returns’ theorems. The advantages of scale efficiency appear more intensive when the involved indicators are situated at the left side of the steady-state levels (low government spending, taxation, and public debt), whereas the diminishing marginal returns become prevalent at the right side of these points (higher government spending, taxation, and public debt). Sociologically, the first slope could be considered a self-reinforcing sequence, and the second a sui-generis self-undermining one. The U-shaped form of the main relationships of government finance therefore approximates the real socioeconomic life. A deeper discussion of these problems exceeds the intended framework of this paper and was evoked only as assumptions of the subsequent analyses. In the empirical research, a database was used for an emergent medium-sized EU economy (Romania, as a case study), with series for two and half decades, namely, 1990–2016. Despite the transformations induced by the transitional processes, after the first package of reforms in 1990s, the structural state–society relationship became, to a great measure, congruent with the functional market economy’s requirements. In principle, therefore, such a database can be admitted as relevant to the paper’s goal. The specificities of an emergent economy could be a profitable challenge to a scientific plan because they extend the cognitive area of an issue developed, until now, preponderantly on advanced occidental countries. More concretely, the involved in-paper indicators refer to the general consolidated budget (GCB), which aggregates data for the central and local public budgets, the social insurance budget, and other similar funds. The classification of GCB revenues and expenditures adopted by the 2012 version of the Romanian macromodel (Dobrescu 2013a, b, 2015b) has been used. This classification is presented in Additional file 1: Appendix A, and the corresponding statistical series are detailed in Additional file 2: Appendix B. This paper continues with a description of the main functional relationships characterizing government finances, including the collinearity problem associated with the U-shaped form of these relationships. More specifically, the Barro–Armey–Rahn–Scully (BARS) curve, the Laffer in narrower sense (LINS) curve, the specifications for non-fiscal public budget revenues (NFBR), and the public budget balance restriction (BBR) are examined separately (like in the literature) and as an integrated model. With such an aim, we introduced a compatibility restriction derived from the unitary framework, within which these functions intimately interact under a given structural state–society relationship. Several conclusions and further possible research opportunities complete the paper.",1
7.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,26 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-018-0116-0,"The static demand multipliers in a joint production framework: comparative findings for the Greek, Spanish and Eurozone economies",December 2018,Theodore Mariolis,Nikolaos Ntemiroglou,George Soklis,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The recession of the years 2008–2009 revealed the fiscal and external imbalances of the so-called Southern Eurozone economies and resulted in incapability of debt refinancing and increasing instability of the banking system. The reform agendas adopted since 2010, basically a mix of contractionary fiscal policy and internal devaluation, seem to have deepened the impact of recession on GDP and unemployment. Regarding the Eurozone (EZ) as a whole, it has been estimated that, between 2011 and 2104, the followed fiscal consolidation actions “came at a considerable cost with an output loss of 7.7% and only a small gain to the primary balance of 0.2% of GDP” (Gechert et al. 2016). These facts and figures probably suggest that the magnitudes of the demand multipliers should be carefully taken into consideration before the implementation of any policy measures. As is now well known, the multiplier for an actual economy does not constitute a scalar but a vector quantity and, therefore, relevant empirical estimations have to zero in on the existing interindustry linkages. Pouring “(some) water into the wine of traditional macroeconomics”, Kurz (1985) introduced and explored the concept of matrix multiplier of autonomous demand in Sraffa’s (1960, Part I) closed-economy framework. Thus, he demonstrated that: “[T]here is no such thing as ‘the’ multiplier. Rather the multiplier effects depend on the technical conditions of production, income distribution, consumption patterns and the physical composition of investment, as well as on savings ratios and the aggregate volume of investment.” (pp. 134–135). It could, furthermore, be shown that this static matrix multiplier includes, as special versions or limit cases, the usual Keynesian multipliers, the multipliers of the traditional input–output analysis and their Marxian versions.Footnote 1 Furthermore, combining the contributions of Malinvaud (1959) and Morishima (1960) with that of Metcalfe and Steedman (1981), Mariolis (2008) extended the static matrix multiplier to the case of an open, linear system involving only circulating capital and producing \(n\) commodities by \(n\) processes (or industries) of pure joint production (‘square’ system). The present paper provides empirical estimations and policy-oriented analysis of the output, import and employment matrix multipliers for two representative Southern EZ economies, i.e., Greece and Spain, and for the EZ economy as a whole. For this purpose, we use: Input–output data from the Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) for the ‘pre-adjustment’ year of 2010.Footnote 2 Since joint production is the empirically relevant case, and since the SUTs may be considered as the empirical counterpart of joint production systems, it follows that these tables constitute a more realistic representation of actual economies than Symmetric Input–Output Tables.Footnote 3
 The analytic framework of Mariolis and Soklis (2018), i.e., a square joint production model of heterogeneous labor involving only circulating capital and competitive imports. The particular structure of this model is imposed by the available SUTs, which provide no data on fixed capital stocks and non-competitive imports. For the case of the Greek economy, they also provide no data on imported intermediate inputs. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines, in brief, the analytic framework.Footnote 4 Section 3 presents and evaluates the main empirical results. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",9

Otherwise, the IPCC has warned that the global warming and climate change will destroy our natural and socioeconomic systems. Consequently, we will face various risks (e.g., heat waves, droughts, floods, food crisis as well as damages to human, social and economic systems) on the earth. To combat the global warming and climate change, we need to establish a “sustainable society” in which we can simultaneously attain both economic prosperity and environmental protection by coordinating social and economic systems. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by UN serves as important guidelines for achieving the sustainable society. Pursuing SDGs is closely linked to corporate management, because environmental problems have been long influencing not only our social and economic systems but also corporate operations in real business world because all industrial sectors need to consider their business strategies that adapt various regulation changes on industrial pollutions. The benefits from installing GHG reduction technologies or green technologies in private sectors range from intangible ones, such as improved public image as “green corporate citizen,” to measurable ones such as reduced GHG emission levels. These benefits, for example, are derived from the promotion of green products and introduction of green supply chain systems in a firm. See Sueyoshi and Goto (2018, Chapter 14) for a detailed description of the history of industrial pollutions after the industrial revolution in the world. In this study, a level of sustainability in various organizations is measured by their operational performance (as an economic prosperity measure) and environmental performance (as a pollution prevention measure) to achieve the sustainable society. A difficulty, associated with attaining a high level of sustainability, is that individuals who are interested in pollution prevention do not have a common practical methodology to assess the performance of organizations in terms of their operational and environmental achievements. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), proposed in this study, is one of such methodologies to assess the environmental performance and more broadly the level of sustainability. As an initial step for such a methodological development applied to corporate sustainability, this study is concerned with a description of difficulties and remedies incorporated in the proposed DEA environmental assessment. Considering these difficulties, this study proposes a new formulation for DEA environmental assessment. Before discussing the proposed approach, it is important to specify the following important features of DEA. First, DEA measures a process of many organizations that utilize inputs to produce desirable outputs (e.g., electricity and services) by relatively comparing each one with others. Second, no functional form specification is necessary for DEA. Finally, we can solve it by linear programming so that DEA has a high computational capability. These are indeed methodological contributions of DEA. However, DEA does not directly incorporate undesirable outputs (e.g., GHG and acid rain gas) in the computational framework because the directional vector (maximization) of desirable outputs and that (minimization) of undesirable outputs. Meanwhile, DEA environmental approach incorporates the existence of undesirable outputs in the computational framework. Thus, it can handle the three types of production factors (inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs) in the performance assessment. As a result, the DEA environmental assessment is computationally more complicated, but has more implications, than the original DEA. The methodological difficulties will be addressed in this study. Here, it is important to note that Sueyoshi et al. (2017) and Sueyoshi and Goto (2018) have provided a list of more than 700 articles on DEA environmental assessment. See also Sueyoshi and Goto (2017) and Sueyoshi and Yuan (2018) that have discussed a recent trend of supply and demand in world energy along with its relationship with DEA applied to energy and environment. This study is a methodological extension of these previous studies. Note that various types of DEA applications can be found in the previous research efforts. Therefore, this study does not document any specific application, rather describing methodological strengths and drawbacks of DEA environmental assessment, all of which have not clearly addressed in these previous efforts. Such is a contribution of this study. An underlying philosophy discussed in this study is that the proposed DEA environmental assessment may serve as an important component for measuring corporate sustainability. Thus, the sustainability enhancement is essential for the management of many firms to survive in a global competition. Moreover, the concept is closely related to corporate social responsibility (CSR).Footnote 1 In this study, environmental assessment is considered as part of CSR, so focusing on a business balance between economic prosperity and environmental protection. Abbreviations used in this study are summarized as follows: CSCs: Complementary Slackness Conditions, CSR: Corporate Social Responsibility, DEA: Data Envelopment Analysis, DTS: Damages to Scale, DMU: Decision Making Unit, DC: Desirable Congestion, NR: Non-radial, RTS: Returns to Scale, UC: Undesirable Congestion, UEN: Unified Efficiency under Natural Disposability, UEM: Unified Efficiency under Managerial disposability, UEM(DC): Unfired Efficiency under Managerial Disposability and Desirable Congestion and URS: Unrestricted. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes methodological pitfalls. Section 3 discusses DEA non-radial models for environmental assessment. Section 4 describes a possible occurrence of undesirable and that of desirable congestions. Section 5 discusses how to incorporate the assumption that undesirable outputs are the by-products of desirable outputs into the proposed framework. Section 6 discusses how to handle zero and negative values. Sections from 3 to 6 document how the proposed new approach can overcome the pitfalls, discussed in this study, related to DEA environmental assessment. Section 7 concludes this study along with future extensions.",2

Aguilar-Hernandez,Carlos Pablo Sigüenza-Sanchez,Arnold Tukker,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the early 1990s, the concept of circular economy was proposed by Pearce and Turner (1990) as a model to transform the traditional open-ended economy into an ongoing closed-loop system from a material perspective. Since then, several scholars and practitioners have adopted multiple definitions for circularity (Winans et al. 2017). After considering 114 conceptual frameworks, Kirchherr et al. (2017) define it as an economic system that substitutes product end-of-life with a set of circularity interventions. Circularity interventions are actions or processes that preserve resources inside the economy (Lieder and Rashid 2016a; Bocken et al. 2017). Such actions are based on three principles (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2013; Ghisellini et al. 2016): Minimising waste disposal through the use of waste flows as inputs for other economic activities; Optimising material loops through the design of products and services that allows extending product lifetime, reuse and recycling materials at their end-of-life; Promoting a restorative environment through the development of renewable energy that decreases material extraction and its environmental impacts. Implementing circularity interventions has become a prominent topic in sustainability policies (McDowall et al. 2017). For instance, the European Commission presented an action plan for the circular economy in which interventions are related to the design of long-lasting products, material closed-loops at multiple supply chain levels, resource efficiency and sustainable waste management (EC 2015). Another example is that of the Chinese circular economy initiatives of the 1990s, which seek to prolong product lifetime and to enhance resource efficiency (Geng et al. 2012, 2016). These and other governments have implemented circularity actions as mechanisms to achieve economic prosperity and environmental sustainability (Andersen 2007; Ghisellini et al. 2016; Geissdoerfer et al. 2017). In order to maximise the economic and environmental benefits of circularity interventions, it is important to assess their cost-effectiveness. This can be done through the application of analytical methods that assess the impact of particular policies (Elia et al. 2017; Potting et al. 2017). However, there is no recognised framework for measuring how effective a country is in making a transition to circularity (EEA 2016; Linder et al. 2017). Such an approach needs to integrate indicators with a clear understanding of the circularity mechanism influencing multiple economic activities and their environmental performance (Lieder and Rashid 2016b; Pauliuk 2017). The assessment of circularity interventions can be addressed by environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIOA). In fact, as described further below, EEIOA has been used to evaluate the impacts of residual waste management, reusing and recycling activities, product lifetime extension, and resource efficiency (Duchin 1992; Iacovidou et al. 2017). Assessing these interventions through EEIOA has in turn required adapting that same framework, leading to the development of new methods. For example, the study of the interdependency between production and waste generation led to the development of waste input–output models (Nakamura 1999b). In addition, the analysis of resource use and emissions at country level in relation to potential leakage on a global level (WEF 2014; Rutherford and Böhringer 2015) resulted in the development of multiregional models for assessing the impacts embodied in international trade (Peters and Hertwich 2009; Wiedmann 2009; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013). Finally, circularity interventions are usually implemented using financial incentives such as subsidies and taxes that need to be endogenised to account for all impacts of the policy (Ferrão et al. 2014). The theoretical integration of financial incentives in the waste input-output model was achieved by Rodrigues et al. (2016). Such adaptations of EEIOA framework have been relevant to evaluate the potential impacts of current circular implementation. To promote the further advancement and implementation of best practices in the use of EEIOA to assess the economic and environmental implications of circularity interventions, it is important to critically evaluate existing studies. To the best of our knowledge, no such review has previously been compiled. We fill this knowledge gap by offering a literature review of EEIOA-based circularity interventions and suggest opportunities for improvement. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methods used in the literature survey. Section 3 presents the actual literature review, describing how in the past circularity interventions have been addressed, organised around four categories: residual waste management, closing supply chains, product lifetime extension, and resource efficiency. Section 4 synthesises the main methodological aspects of each intervention type. Section 5 then discusses the major contributions and limitations as well as opportunities for improvement and Sect. 6 closes with some final remarks.",38

For instance, wage growth dynamically affects exchange rates, inflation and in particular a country’s competitiveness in international trade. To understand the wage dynamics in Turkey, workdays lost to strikes must be taken into account because this gives trade unions the power to stand against low wage growth policy and to push for higher wage growth on the wage-bargaining table. In other words, the more workdays lost to strikes, the more government and industries incline to bow to the demands of trade unions. The first question is how workdays lost to strikes have impacted on wage growth in Turkey. The second question is how to develop new policies for preventing high wage growth that is not compensated by productivity growth. In essence, if the problem is solved, this can help reduce inflation and bring stability to the macroeconomic picture. The formula called the mathematical base social contract, a new wage-setting and inflation-controlling policy, can serve as the institutional solution for answering these questions.Footnote 1
 The main motivation of this research is to prove how industrial actions can have a devastating influence on macroeconomic factors by implementing an empirical analysis. Although it is widely accepted that industrial actions are the principal reason behind high wage growth, there are only a few empirical studies on this, and there has not been an outstanding empirical work that took Turkey into account. There are several reasons why this has not been researched sufficiently. The first is about the transparency of statistics on industrial actions. The data of workdays lost to strikes are difficult to collect or access on a daily or monthly basis because wage bargaining usually happens once or twice a year, either with government or the employers’ associations. Thus, collecting annual data to create a satisfactory model with enough time spans takes time. Second, the institutionalization of trade unions has remained behind economic development. For instance, in Turkey, although mechanization or industrial development began in the early 1950s, trade unions were only legalized in the early 1960s. In other words, after the technological change in the economy, Turkish peasants moved to industrial cities and became workers, something that had happened in the developed countries long before. After this economic phenomenon, trade unions were legalized by the government and could organize larger members. The difficulties pointed out above also made it hard to compare Turkey with a number of developing countries in terms of industrial actions because most countries have not made available enough data to facilitate a comparative analysis, or have lagged behind in the development process.Footnote 2 However, Turkey provides the chance to conduct such an analysis since it has regularly shared data on industrial actions since the early 1960s. The country has consistently released detailed statistics about industrial actions, enabling a time-series analysis. In consequence, it is possible to discuss the wage policy of the country in this research. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the economic literature for understanding the power of trade unions and its influence on wage growth, and to serve as a resource for the creation of new empirical analyses for other countries. There is no direct research that can be used to estimate the effect of workdays lost to strikes on wage growth, but there is some indirect research. Card and Olson (1995) tried to show a systematic relation between the determinants of strike success and the determinants of the wage gain for successful strikes in the USA. This work indicates that successful strikes mostly created significant wage gains and failed strikes always resulted in no change in wages.Footnote 3 Irfan (1982) explained changes in industrial employment, unionization and real wages for Pakistan. He estimated that the real wages of industrial workers were influenced by unionization, manufacturing output growth and minimum wage legislation. For the Turkish economy, Yüksel (1999) described the political, social and economical results of strikes. His work points out that manufacturing industries are where workers are most willing to organize strikes. Alesina and Giavazzi (2006) discussed how the lobbying power of trade unions on governments directly influences economic policy in many European countries, and how this lobbying factor blocks reforms which might otherwise create a system called flexicurity, which provides flexible and secure conditions for the workers. In some previous research, Turkey was analyzed in terms of its integration into the EMU and its relationship with China (Ünal 2016a, b, 2017).Footnote 4 These papers demonstrated that the most important cause of low competitiveness in Turkey was its very high wage growth, which was not compensated by productivity growth. Therefore, in this paper, it is important to highlight what factors caused high wage growth by calculating productivity growth rates via input–output tables, and connecting the assumptions to the empirical analysis. This paper provides a concrete analysis of the role trade unions’ power plays, and how conflict in wage negotiations can be eliminated via the mathematical base social contract, new wage-setting and inflation policy. In Sect. 2, the methodology of the research and connection between wage growth, inflation and exchange rates are discussed in order to explain the importance of wage growth. For this, input–output analysis is used to estimate productivity growth and unit labor cost (ULC), and their impact on inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP). In Sect. 3, trade unions and wage–labor relations are discussed from a historical perspective. In Sect. 4, the dynamic effects of workdays lost to strikes, inflation and real GDP on wage growth are examined by forecast error variance decomposition and impulse response function in the framework VAR model (Sims 1980). In Sect. 5, results are discussed and institutional changes are recommended.",2

Otherwise, the IPCC has warned that the global warming and climate change will destroy our natural and socioeconomic systems. Consequently, we will face various risks (e.g., heat waves, droughts, floods, food crisis as well as damages to human, social and economic systems) on the earth. A difficulty in attaining such a sustainable society is that we do not have a methodology to properly assess economic development and pollution reduction in a unified manner because the former development has been usually associated with various types of pollutions. To partly deal with the difficulty, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been used as a methodology for performance assessment on organizations, whose economic activities are characterized by desirable outputs and inputs. A problem was that conventional DEA documented a limited level of practicality in environmental assessment because it did not have a computational scheme to handle an existence of undesirable outputs. To overcome such a difficulty, many research efforts have developed new approaches and related models for DEA environmental assessment which measure the performance of various organizations that produce not only desirable outputs but also undesirable outputs. See recent literature studies such as Sueyoshi and Goto (2018), listing more than 800 previous works. See also Sueyoshi et al. (2017b) for a summary on 693 articles on DEA applied to energy and sustainability and Sueyoshi et al. (2017c) for comparison among radial, non-radial and intermediate approaches in DEA assessment. In reviewing the previous studies, we find that not many research efforts have examined the performance assessment on energy usage and sustainability in Asian nations even if they have been developing their economic prosperities in a short period, but simultaneously suffering from various pollution problems. In particular, China and India are such good examples of such a rapid development. In contrast, Asia contains many underdeveloped nations such as Bangladesh and North Korea. As a consequence of such existence of large developed and small undeveloped nations, previous DEA studies have not yet explored the relationship between energy usage and sustainability development in Asia. To measure the sustainability of Asia nations from 2008 to 2014, this study proposes a new use of a DEA intermediate approach, analytically locating between conventional (radial and non-radial) approaches. Using the new approach, this study is interested in measuring how to improve the level of sustainability in Asian from an efficient usage of their primary and secondary energies. That is the purpose of this research. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews previous research efforts on DEA applied to energy usages in Asia. Section 3 discusses underlying concepts to unify desirable and undesirable outputs, used in the proposed intermediate approach for DEA environmental assessment. Section 4 describes the mathematical structure of the intermediate approach. Section 5 applies it to the sustainability assessment of all Asian nations.

Thomassin,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership renamed as the Comprehensive and Progressive agreement for Transpacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a proposed free trade agreement involving 12 Asia-Pacific countries (Fergusson et al. 2016). The Trans-Pacific Partnership was developed from the Trans-Pacific Economic Partnership Agreement (P4) between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore in 2006. The agreement contains aspects of the past trade agreements on agriculture, forestry, fisheries and industrial goods where tariff reductions and/or eliminations have been negotiated while incorporating new areas such as electronic commerce. There are currently 11 other countries involved in the partnership apart from Canada, and these are Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, USA and Vietnam. Decisions on membership are made by the existing members of the partnership. Besides the new trade agreements introduced by the TPP (CPTPP), these agreements will coexist with existing free trade agreements. TPP is a living agreement which makes it possible for membership to be expanded to include other countries. It also has an extensive coverage (Lakatos et al. 2016). Canada has a number of free trade agreements with some TPP members, including the USA and Mexico under the NAFTA, as well as Chile and Peru under the Canada–Chile and Canada–Peru FTAs. The TPP agreement formulates new FTAs with seven Asian nations—Australia, Brunei, Dar-es-Salaam, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. Canada’s bilateral trade is marginal with these seven partners except with Japan—the third largest economy in the world. The agreement is expected to be a platform for future trade agreements which benefit the economies of participating countries by liberalizing trade and investment. The partnership also incorporates new areas and agreements that go beyond those existing in the World Trade Organisation (Fergusson et al. 2016). These agreements are different from the traditional trade agreements because they incorporate cooperation on difficult trade policy issues such as regulatory barriers which have been complex to tackle so far. TPP makes this possible (Lakatos et al. 2016). Different countries have market access for different goods and services. The negotiations were concluded in 2015, but the final agreement was signed in 2016. Ratification would create the largest trade zone in the world, spanning four continents and 800 million people. Table 1 shows the GDP contribution of TPP member nations in 2013(27.5 Trillion USD), its scope accounts for 40% of the world’s economic output. The share of Canada’s trade with TPP countries other than the USA is 11%. Despite the presence of many barriers to trade, Canada’s exports to TPP countries averaged $366.1 billion CAD annually from 2012 to 2014. Industrial goods comprise the major portion of exports, i.e. $311.4 billion CAD, followed by agriculture and agri-food ($30.9) and forestry and wood products ($20.4). TPP countries get duty-free access to 3.25 and 2.1% of Canada’s dairy and poultry market, respectively. Over time, tariffs among members of the TPP would be eliminated for a number of products, thus lowering trade barriers significantly even for countries which apply high tariffs to particular products. It also seeks to enhance the development of supply chains which involve careful coordination of production decisions, rules on shipping, investment and the transfer of information among different countries. TPP incorporates social, labour and environmental standards such as standards that address illegal wildlife trafficking and logging and strengthen copyright terms which is likely to have an impact on trade and production chains (Lakatos et al. 2016). Some of the agreements of the TPP by the Canadian government are for the elimination of tariffs on products such as pork, fruits, canola, machinery and minerals; increased mobility of high skilled and business workers; increased import of foreign car parts and the compensation of losses faced by farmers under the TPP through a series of multibillion dollar programmes such as quota protection, modernizing equipment and marketing assistance. Throughout the implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Canadian-EU Trade Agreement, the government of Canada has introduced a number of initiatives for producers and processors. For instance, the income guarantee programme, quota value guarantee programme, market development initiative and processor modernization programme have been introduced by the government to support supply-managed producers and processors. These initiatives are to provide income protection for producers, promote marketing of top quality goods and encourage competitiveness and growth. Rules, custom procedures and technical standards put in place by the TPP decreases production cost for farmers and also makes it easier for countries to transact business among each other. By being a part of the TPP negotiations, Canada can put forth proposals that will be in their best interest and therefore influence the rules that govern trade relationships (Dawson and Bartucci 2013). Generally, the TPP agreements lead to better trade which results in greater competition, efficiency in productivity, lower prices, restraining inflation and making diverse goods and services available to consumers. Overall, Canada will benefit from improved market access for food, meat, fish, alcohol products, industrial products, metals and minerals and also the services sectors. This occurs through the strengthening of partnership with existing trade partners and access to markets in Asia. Besides expansion, Canada will benefit from trade and investment diversification, since most of its exports are skewed towards the USA and scarcely any to countries such as Mexico, Peru and Chile. This expansion and diversification in trade and investment will lead to an increase in the market presence in these and other countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam and result in the growth in Canada’s exports. TPP is expected to cover approximately 80% of Canada’s exports after all the partners come on board. Participating in this partnership is important for Canada because most of the TPP members are wealthy growing economies with younger population who would be interested in purchasing goods and services that Canada can offer such as financial services, energy, education and technology. TPP will increase Canada’s integration with other fast growing Asian markets and economies. TPP is likely to reduce risk and uncertainty for exporters and investors in the long run (Dawson and Bartucci 2013). Canada benefits from the TPP agreement in numerous ways. Canada is expected to have a country-specific quota in Japan for wheat which starts at 40,000 tonnes and increases to 53,000 tonnes within 6 years. It will also have access to a TPP-wide quota for food barley starting from 25,000 to 65,000 tonnes within 8 years. The TPP agreement will lead to a reduction or elimination of existing taxes on processed food and non-alcoholic beverages (maple syrup, baked goods, sugar and chocolate confectionery) in countries such as Japan and Vietnam where Canada’s export of these products face high tariffs. This will be highly beneficial to the Canadian economy since the agricultural and agri-food industry is a key processing sub-sector which contributed approximately $27.7 billion to the country’s economy in 2013 (Global Affairs Canada, Govt. of Canada). Within 2 years (2012–2014), Canada’s export of canola oil to TPP countries, largely to Japan, totalled $1.8 billion annually. In the same period, Canada’s export of processed food and non-alcoholic beverages to TPP countries was, on average, $7.3 billion annually. The TPP agreement will improve the market access opportunities for the wines and spirits sector in Canada through the removal of tariffs in countries such as Japan, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand. In Vietnam and Australia, duties up to 55 and 5%, respectively, on whisky will be eliminated within 12 years of the agreement coming into force. Streamlined processes at the border and trade facilitating rules such as the elimination of tariffs up to 16.8% on sweetened dried cranberries in Japan could lead to an increase in Canadian exports. The market access for fish and seafood such as frozen snow crab, herring roe, lobster, shrimps, scallops, mussels and salmon will also be improved with the elimination of tariffs in Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam. The TPP agreement improves Canada’s industrial trade to Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Malaysia. The industries include those of wood and related products, industrial goods, metals and minerals, chemicals and plastics, ICT and life science products, machines and equipment and cosmetics. For instance, the two way investment between Canada and Australia was valued at $30.3 billion in 2014. In the automobile industry, TPP provides access into new markets where free trade agreements did not exist for Canada. This will be made possible through the elimination of tariffs for all vehicles and vehicle parts into TPP market and also through better access for Canadian automotive exports to Vietnam and Malaysia. The integration between the Canadian and the North American auto industry is also protected and strengthened as a result of the agreement. Examples of Canadian metals and minerals that will benefit from tariff elimination are aluminium products, iron and steel, petroleum products. Also, plastic bags, plates, pipes and sheets are examples of Canadian exports of chemicals and plastics that will benefit from tariff elimination. Tariffs up to approximately 17, 4 and 20%, respectively, in Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia will be eliminated upon the TPP agreement coming into force. New opportunities for Canada’s aerospace sector will be enhanced through the TPP agreement by providing considerable certainty for the exports of aerospace-related goods and services. This would be achieved through the implementation of rules that promote non-discrimination and transparency in government procedures and also demonstrate Canada’s production realities and methods. These agreements will further promote transparent cross-border trade services as well as temporary entry of business persons which will improve the market access for professional services, research and development, environmental, construction and transportation services. New commitments have been assured for particular high skilled professionals and technicians from Australia, Brunei, Peru, Chile and Mexico. Under the TPP agreement, tariff elimination on industrial machinery such as compressors and pumps, agricultural machinery, such as harvesters and movers, and construction equipment, such as lifting, loading, handling, moving and grading machinery, will generate export opportunities for high-quality Canadian machinery. In addition to these benefits, the TPP provides commitments that go further than trade agreements made by the World Trade Organisation and Canada’s free trade agreements with several members of the TPP agreement, such as, market access for environmental services in Vietnam and Malaysia. Canada also benefits from voluntary deliberations of mutual recognition agreements between its authorities and their counterparts in TPP countries and from the access to free data which is made available through the transparent framework of the TPP. Discrimination against Canadian service suppliers is diminished or eliminated in TPP markets making it easier for them to provide their services freely in different countries. The agreement promotes the participation of Canadian financial companies in the TPP market which increases the potential for growth in the financial sector. This is due to the fact that the agreement protects existing investments, deals with discriminatory barriers to entry into the market, encourages competition and communication among financial regulators, creates transparency in regulatory regimes and enables policymakers to protect the interests of consumers of financial services. Canada will therefore gain from improved investment protection, protection against expropriation and violation of minimum standards of treatment and enhanced ability to transfer funds abroad. It is worth noting that Canada’s existing policies for protecting and sustaining the country’s cultural context are protected under the TPP. It is expected that TPP member countries which includes Canada will have their GDP increase by 0.4–10% by 2030 after implementation of the TPP. This increase will be due to tariff cuts in goods and services (Lakatos et al. 2016). It could result in annual income gains of $9.9 billion and increased exports of $15.7 billion for Canada (Dawson and Bartucci 2013). On 23 January 2017, Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum confirming the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Canada’s potential economic gains from the TPP agreement depend on the participation of the USA—under the TPP agreement. There are a number of issues that would potentially influence Canada’s existing economic ties with the USA when the TPP agreement comes into force. Most importantly, Canada already has preferential market access to the USA and Mexico under NAFTA. Liberalization of the US and Mexican markets for other TPP members would erode the preferences that Canada currently enjoys under the NAFTA, resulting in a displacement of Canada’s exports to the USA and Mexico. Canada’s preference in the US market would be partially offset by the gains from the new FTA countries under the TPP agreement; however, the importance and size of the US market for Canada’s trade might not be significant enough to offset the losses in the US market.Footnote 1
 Similarly, Canada’s trade with new FTA partners under the TPP would likely displace US and Mexican exports to Canada. As a result, Canada’s bilateral trade with existing FTA partner countries is expected to decline under the TPP agreement. Net Canadian exports to the existing FTA partner countries would drop by US $1.5 billion, largely due to an erosion of NAFTA preferences in the USA and Mexico, while imports from these partner countries will also decline by US $4.3 billion (Global Affairs Canada 2016). The sector that will be affected the most is the automotive sector. With more than 80% of Canadian automotive production exported to the USA, Canadian automotive production will experience a decline. Overall, Canadian exports of automotive products to the USA are projected to decline by US $3.6 billion, or a 4.7% decline in total Canadian automotive product exports to the USA (Global Affairs Canada 2016). Another important issue under the trade agreement is Rules of Origin (ROO). The ROO requirement is set at a lower rate in the TPP as compared to NAFTA rules.Footnote 2 Under NAFTA, the rules of origin threshold for preferential treatment for assembled vehicles is 62.5%, while under the TPP the threshold is 45%. This lower requirement has important consequences across countries. This means that, under the TPP, automakers have the possibility to source a greater proportion of auto parts from countries outside of the agreement than is currently the case under NAFTA. This is expected to translate into efficiency gains for Canadian automotive producers, but, on balance, would result in losses in both production and investment in the automotive industry (2% approx.). This is primarily driven by reduced US demand for Canadian automotive parts as US automotive producers are able to source more parts from non-TPP members, thereby displacing Canadian exports to the USA. Furthermore, US commitments under the TPP for sugar and services are likely to provide new opportunities beyond NAFTA to expand Canadian exports to the US market. The professional services and exports of sugar products would increase considerably. Given the size of the US economy, the USA plays a pivotal role among TPP members and their participation in the agreement is needed for the full benefit of the TPP agreement to be reached. To realize its full effect, the deal would have to be ratified by February 2018 by at least 6 countries with 85% of global economic output. The USA would need to be on board to meet the last condition. Some countries, including New Zealand, have suggested some sort of alternative deal may be possible without the USA. But Japan is not as hopeful. Some studies have investigated the TPP impact on member and non-member countries; however, there are few studies focusing on Canada. World Bank (2016) shows that the TPP agreement could raise member country GDP by an average of 1.1% by 2030 and increase trade by 11% over the same period. To the extent that the agreement has positive spillovers to non-members, and detrimental effects through trade diversion and preference erosion could be limited. World Bank (2016) estimated the overall impact of the TPP on member and non-TPP member countries; however, they did not analyse the impact from a single country perspective in general and Canada in particular. Even though the study used a dynamic CGE model, the tariff reduction strategy is different from this study. Further, the selection of sectors is more appropriately addressed in the current study using the actual tariff reduction announcement in the agreement. Further, the study added another simulation exercise where the developing member countries experience input augmenting technical changes due to the likely development of production networks within the region. A descriptive study by Dawson and Bartucci (2013) shows that annual income gains and increases in exports will be $9.9 billion and $15.7 billion for Canada. However, the TPP does not offer Canada strong market access gains in the short term; instead, the agreement is important for a series of strategic and defensive reasons. Global Affairs Canada (2016) assesses the potential economic impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP) on the Canadian economy. They attempted two scenarios: the first had Canada joining the TPP as a member and the second, did not have Canada joining the TPP. The study shows a net advantage to Canada resulting from increased market access and greater regional economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries, if the nation joins TPP. If Canada chooses to remain outside the TPP agreement, this would present several risks to Canada’s economic well-being, which could lead to total GDP losses of approximately $5.3 billion. The study objective was quite different than the current study. Moreover, all the above studies considered the TPP agreement in its original form when the USA was one of the negotiating countries. There is no study which discussed the impact of TPP on Canada excluding USA, to the best of our knowledge. Given this context, it is essential to study the TPP impact on the Canadian economy with and without the USA as a member. The study evaluates the economy wide impact of the TPP agreement on Canada and other member countries including the USA in terms of output growth, export, import, income and welfare. The study also attempted another similar exercise without the USA. Further, it attempts two different types of simulations including tariff reductions and technological upgradation. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the calibration of the global CGE model that was developed for the study. This includes the data and aggregation strategy. Section 3 explains the experimental design of the scenarios. The analysis of results of the study is presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the paper with policy recommendations.",1

Second, what is Turkey’s growth model, and why it is still far from institutional complementarity? Two main concepts, growth models and institutional factors, can be used to define the economic and social changes in an economy. These concepts not only point out economic and political problems, but also effect a compromise between institutional changes and growth models, which serve to describe necessary arrangements inside an economy and help realize institutional complementarity between macroeconomic and institutional factors. Hence, using an institutional approach will enable exploration of the connection between regulation in a capitalist economy and its historical evolution (Jessop and Sum 2006a, b: 1–3). Regulations emerge as a result of a change in a production system based on macroeconomic factors, which can be defined by growth models. As the production system changes in an economy, regulations usually remain slow, which causes an economy to follow radical institutional changes to create a compromise between the growth model and institutional factors. However, that does not mean each institutional change can create institutional complementarity based on macroeconomic factors. One of the reasons for the slowing of growth in the Turkish economy pre-2003 was its slow regulations under the dysfunctional governments. Radical regulations were practically established or supported after low economic performance in Turkey in the 1960s, which transformed the economy into one which was closed and protected, with import substitution industrialization based on domestic consumption growth after technological change from agricultural growth. In the early 1980s, increasing economic and political problems weakened government and gave way to new institutional changes and supported regulations for export growth. Nevertheless, the period of 1985–2003 remained a long transformation process for the Turkish economy. Finally, in the 2000s, regulations which made the Turkish economy stronger compared to that of the pre-2003 period were created by the government and supported by international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the EU.Footnote 1 The main reasons for economic crises in Turkey are flaws in its institutional factors, which conflicted with its macroeconomic factors. To avoid similar crises in future, institutional factors should be evaluated and reformed. Possible reforms that may occur in institutional factors could eliminate the influence of a crisis and stabilize the economy. Therefore, to create new institutional changes, the current growth model in an economy must be properly known and understood. In this work, Turkey and its growth strategies particularly from 1950 are considered. The Turkish economy went through several important periods. These periods were 1923–1962, 1962–1985, 1985–2003 and post-2003. The main institutional changes that influenced and contributed to the future of the Turkish economy emerged in the periods after economic crises. The institutional changes used in this paper are inspired by the régulation theory. According to the régulation theory, there are five institutional factors: bank and credit relations, wage and labor relations, mode of competition, mode of international insertion and the role of government (Boyer 1990: 38–39; Boyer and Hollingsworth 1997: 49–54; Boyer and Saillard 2002: 44). However, these concepts encapsulate many factors. To make it more descriptive, the important concepts that influenced the Turkish economy over time are used, and summarized in Table 8. The wage-labor relation is one of the important concepts of the régulation theory (Boyer and Yamada 2000: 10). The wage-labor relation can be influenced by income policies related to trade unions and modes of employment. Therefore, wage-labor relations consist of productivity growth, wage growth, and their interaction with inflation in the economy. The position of labor in sectors will be taken into account. Another important concept for the Turkish economy is related to exchange rate systems. The position of a country in international insertion can consist of exchange rate and competitiveness, which affect the trade balance, and is influenced by productivity growth and wage rate growth inside the economy. The production base of the important industries will be considered, and the role of privatizations in the economy will be highlighted. The mode of economy is depended on the macroeconomic perspectives of an open or closed economy. The government, with its regulatory intervention and role in the economy, will be considered. There are plenty of works in which to find institutional changes in the developed countries, and some works about the Latin American countries, which define their growth regimes and institutional factors (Aboites et al. 2002: 280–287). There have been some works which have analyzed the Turkish economy from an institutional perspective in order to explain its transformation in terms of macroeconomic and institutional factors, including wage-labor relations and exchange rate systems (Ünal 2016a, b, 2017). In that work, which differs from previous research, the Turkish economy is analyzed using broad concepts of institutional factors, and with a deeper theoretical and historical perspective, covering important periods of the economy when chronic problems emerged. In Sect. 2, stylized facts of structural transformation are discussed. The macroeconomic growth models designed by input–output analysis and assumptions are explained. In Sect. 3, major developed countries (Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States) were briefly examined in terms of stylized facts of structural transformation, macroeconomic and institutional factors. In Sect. 4, Turkey’s transformation from agricultural growth to domestic consumption growth is identified. Institutional factors in the period of agricultural growth are examined, and the reasons for the economic crisis in that period are discussed. Because of its parallel institutional factors, Turkey is compared with the developed countries by deriving input–output tables. Moreover, institutional changes that shaped domestic consumption growth in the period of 1962–1985 are explained, and the reasons for economic crisis under the domestic growth policies are clarified. In addition, the transformation into export growth is depicted in terms of institutional factors, and the importance of the 2000–2001 economic crisis is extensively discussed. Finally, in Table 8, macroeconomic and institutional factors, in the context of their periods, are clearly laid out.",6
7.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,10 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-017-0103-x,Economic implications of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on Pakistan: a CGE approach,December 2018,Muhammad Aamir Khan,Naseeb Zada,Kakali Mukhopadhyay,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The successful performance of multilateral free trade agreements, such as Association of South East Asian nations (ASEAN), North Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) coupled with the failure of the Doha Development Round (DDR), has inspired other economies to integrate their economies with rest of the world through the instrument of trade liberalization under the large world integrations. This strategy led to the establishment of various regional integrations such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). CPTPP is a proposed agreement being negotiated between the economies of the Asia-Pacific region. It is an expansion of the existing free trade agreement between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. Currently CPTPP is negotiated between 11 economies including the existing four economies plus Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam. The economic objective of CPTPP (formerly named as TPP) is to create a platform of a deep economic integration and comprehensive free trade agreement.Footnote 1 Through CPTPP, participating countries seek to liberalize and establish new rules and disciplines in the region beyond those that already exist in the WTO (Fergusson et al. 2015). Banga (2014) points out that CPTPP would be beyond the existing trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region with a vast coverage of new ideas, investments, services, financial services, competition, government procurement, labor, intellectual property, environment, etc. Cheong and Tongzon (2013) argues that CPTPP is a mega trade agreement. Therefore, the foremost objective should be its economic value and should be open for other economies fulfilling the preliminary requirements. CPTPP itself is a deep and targeting economic integration with provisions that range from goods, services and investment to critical new issues such as the digital economy, intellectual property rights, regulatory coherence, labor and the environment (Petri and Plummer 2016). Due to the US’ withdrawal, CPTPP may not be more effective and is no more threat to China. However, it is still a threat to the East Asian integration. It will attract some of the ASEAN economies that have various partnerships with China. Pakistan is not a part of the proposed CPTPP which might yield losses due to the trade diversion. The potential loss can be attributed to a yarn forward rule (YFR), according to which, it is obligatory for all the CPTPP members to acquire the components of manufacturing products from other CPTPP member economies. Thus, YFR will induce garment manufacturers in the CPTPP countries to source their inputs from CPTPP countries at the cost of non-CPTPP countries. This will be a clear case of trade diversion for non-CPTPP countries like Pakistan, India and China, i.e., moving trade away from more efficient producers to less efficient producers. This will most likely to disrupt regional and global supply chain in textile and clothing. It is pertinent to mention here that textile and clothing sector accounts for roughly 8.5 percent of Pakistan’s GDP, 45% of its total labor force and provides livelihood support to 10–15 million people directly or indirectly (GoP, 2016). USA is one of the biggest export destinations of Pakistan with export share of 15%. However, CPTPP even with US exit is still significant for Pakistan’s bilateral trade flows. The share of Pakistan exports to CPTPP in 2014 is 6%. The share of TPP in total Pakistan’s imports is, however, relatively more considerable as compared to exports, i.e., share of TPP in total Pakistan’s import is 11% in 2014. Figure 1 illustrates trend in the growth of Pakistan’s bilateral trade with CPTPP. CPTPP share in Pakistan's Trade The above discussion implies that Pakistan has significant trade links with the CPTPP economies and therefore it may face losses due to the possible trade diversion from CPTPP. A large number of studies have identified the impact on non-members of CPTPP especially on small developing economies which are excluded from CPTPP. For instance, studies of Rahman and Ara (2015) consider the impact on Nepal and Bangladesh, Ganesh-Kumar and Chatterjee (2016) and Narayanan and Sharma (2016) for India, Cororaton and Orden (2015) for Philippines, Durongkaveroj (2015) for Thailand, Li and Yao (2014) and Lu (2015) for China, Oduncu et al. (2014) for Turkey and Thorstensen and Ferraz (2014) for Brazil. The potential impact of TPP on various economies in the framework of the CGE model is summarized in Table 1. Above discussion on the literature shows that CPTPP has a worldwide impact. The impact on most of the CPTPP members is positive, but the literature also illustrates high welfare losses to most of the non-CPTPP members, such as Pakistan, Turkey, India and China. However, there is no significant study conducted to address the possible economic implication of CPTPP on Pakistan economy. Against this backdrop, the current study is carried out to evaluate the possible impact of CPTPP on the economy of Pakistan.",11

Thomassin,Jingyuan Zhang,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The world faces multiple challenges in strengthening food security that ranges from rapid transition of diet consumption patterns of a continuously increasing population to constantly decreasing cultivated land and inefficient production practices (Beddington et al. 2012). The world population has increased from 6.4 billion in 2004 to 7.4 billion in 2016, and it is expected to reach 9.4 billion by 2050 (World Bank 2014a, 2016). In addition, the global average food consumption has increased from 2250 calories per capita per day in 1961 to 2750 calories per capita per day in 2007. This figure is projected to rise to 3070 calories per person per day by 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). However, 870 million out of 7.04 billion people still experience transitory hunger. Moreover, over 98% of these hungry people live in developing countries (FAO 2009; WFP and IFAD 2012). Therefore, food insecurity is still a serious global issue. Strengthening food security is a focus for many countries, and it is a significant development strategy for the People’s Republic of China. Food security in China can promote economic development, maintain social stability, and achieve national self-sufficiency (Zhou 2010). For the last two decades, China’s food security has attracted great attention due to its growing population, improving purchasing power and soaring demand for animal feed and biofuel. On the other hand, agricultural production is a critical component of China’s economy and peoples lives. Additionally, agricultural development continues to lag behind industrial development. It poses a significant challenge because China’s agricultural production provides 1.3 billion people with food, 737 million rural people’s incomes depend on agricultural production and 42.6% of the labor force is employed in agricultural sector. However, agricultural production only accounts for 10% of GDP even though 35.4 billion dollars of exports herald from the agricultural sector and 66% of the light industry outputs are based on agricultural products (China 2008; National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010; World Bank 2014b). China’s population has increased over 30% since 1980 and is predicted to reach 1.3406 billion by 2050 (World Bank 2013). At present, China’s total GDP ranks second in the world, and its annual GDP growth rate is approximately 8.6% (World Bank 2014b). An upward trend in income has tripled food demand in the past 30 years (Liao 2010), and more arable land is made uncultivable as a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization. The per capita land resources in China are only equivalent to 0.38% of the world average (World Bank 2014c). Limited arable land has attracted more attention by government. The grain sufficiency rate of China is in danger of becoming lower than the target rate of 95% self-sufficiency, which is considered a key national food security indicator from the Chinese government’s perspective. To feed approximately 22% of the world’s population on less than 9% of the world’s cropland is a major challenge. As a result, food security is a fundamental issue for policy makers and requires immediate attention. Several major factors have caused cultivable land to shrink in China, such as converting agricultural land to residential or industrial areas. At present, only 12.8% of the total national land area is available for agricultural production (Chen 2007). In addition, China’s increased agricultural harvest in the past years to some extent can be attributed to the overuse of fertilizer and pesticide (Huang et al. 2012a). This is not a sustainable approach for a country that aims to maintain a stable grain supply in the long term. It is crucial to limit the loss of arable land to ensure food security. In response, the Chinese government has unveiled a series of new regulations and standards to safeguard sufficient arable land. Government has set, what it calls, a Red Line to guarantee that the amount of arable land never goes below 120 million hectares (1800 million mu). However, whether this red line is enough for the population in 2030 and 2050 remains a concern. Since 2010, China has changed its position in the world grain market from net exporter to net importer. The total grain trade deficit has increased significantly to $4 billion in 2013. Since joining the WTO, China has undertaken a series of tariff reductions policy mostly towards agricultural products. Major grain products, i.e., rice and wheat, are in the tariff reduction exception list, which triggers a controversial discussion on trade liberalization and food security. Additionally, the Government of China has identified a 95% self-sufficiency goal as an objective of government policy for recent years (The CCCPC and The State Council 2014). In 2008, the agricultural productivity of China was 47% of the world on an average, while only 2% of the same was recorded high-income countries (Wang 2012) indicating great disparity. Recently, the government of China introduced policies to encourage farmers to buy agricultural machinery. Inadequate irrigation system has become a serious constraint for agricultural production (Wang 2012), and the degree of agricultural mechanization is very low in China, even though China’s government has subsidized agricultural machinery in recent years. Even though extensive agricultural machinery application is believed to improve productivity, this issue still needs further study in the case of China. Low rural income and the high price of machinery is another reason for the low application rate of large-scale agricultural machinery.Footnote 1 The application of agricultural machinery largely depends on government subsidy (Liu 2013). Given the present conditions in Chinese agriculture, the country appears to be on the frontline of the global food security crisis. Effective research on food security is required to ensure the national stability and to improve the well-being in China. The current study will address several key questions such as how much cultivable land is required for feeding the Chinese population in 2030 and 2050. What are the implications of meat and grain tariff reductions on China’s food security in the future? Answers to the above questions are significant for the Chinese government to formulate appropriate reforms that can strengthen national food security in future decades. The objectives of this study are to investigate China’s food security situation in 2030 and investigate the impacts of alternative policies on food security. The analysis is based on a global computable general equilibrium model, which covers a large number of regions and detailed agricultural information. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews methodologies that have been used in food security assessment. Section 3 calibrates Global CGE model that have been employed in the study including data and aggregation strategy and experimental design. The results of the study are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the paper with policy recommendations.",36

The rate of rural poverty is also high, with 26% of rural households living below the poverty line (UNDP 2018). Stunting and wasting in children younger than 5 constitute 40.4 and 8.7%, respectively (IFPRI 2015) which suggests that food insecurity is a serious problem in the country and that many households are vulnerable to it. Although there are efforts to reduce the prevalence of poverty and vulnerability to food insecurity (VFI), both chronic and transitory food insecurity persist at the household level and millions of people are still vulnerable due to different shocks and stresses. Between the time when the current government [the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)] came to power in 1991 and 2003, most Ethiopian food security policies have focused on relief and emergency plans. Thereafter, the food security program was launched in 2003 under the framework of the federal government’s food security strategy, and the productive safety net program formally launched in 2005 in selected chronically food-insecure districts. The main goal of these programs is to improve the food security status of chronically and transitory food-insecure people through resettlement programs, household asset building programs, as well as complimentary community investment, including public works projects such as soil and water conservation (SWC) practices, road construction, and natural resource rehabilitation. However, studies indicate that levels of poverty and vulnerability in Ethiopia remain very high (IFPRI 2015; FAO 2016; Dercon and Christiaensen 2011; Fentaw et al. 2013; Dercon et al. 2012; Kumar and Quisumbing 2012). On average, 32% and 40% of the Ethiopia’s population are undernourished and consume less than the recommended daily calories, respectively (IFPRI 2015). Moreover, the FAO (2016) situation report indicates that more than 10.2 million people needed food assistance in 2016, more than at any other time since 2006. The prevalence of food insecurity and related vulnerability is generally high in rural parts of Ethiopia, where 79% of the population live (World Bank 2018), with rain-fed subsistence farming dominating agricultural production. The level of vulnerability and food insecurity mainly depends on the performance of agriculture (Demeke et al. 2011; Collier et al. 2008; Di Falco et al. 2011). Therefore, household vulnerability and food security largely depends on a combination of both natural and man-made factors, including rainfall patterns, land degradation, population density, climate change, low levels of rural investment, volatile input and grain prices, drought, pest hazard, frost, and flooding (Gelaw and Sileshi 2013; WFP 2011; Dercon and Christiaensen 2007; Dercon and Krishnan 1998). In addition, access to different resources and institutional factors, such as access to land and labor, infrastructure, technologies, credit, and geographic suitability also affect the level of vulnerability and food insecurity though the channels of agricultural production and rural income (Gelaw 2010; Bevan 2000; Dercon and Krishnan 1998). Furthermore, empirical findings by Dercon and Christiaensen (2007), Dercon and Krishnan (1998), and Capaldo et al. (2010) also show that in many developing countries, such as Ethiopia, food security is mostly unstable, fluctuating over time. According to Capaldo et al. (2010) and Dercon and Krishnan (2000), access to adequate food for many households varies over time due to households’ proneness to shocks and other risks, such as floods, land degradation, and extreme climate conditions, and their capacity to recover and respond. This implies that the concept of food insecurity is best thought of as dynamic rather than static in nature (Capaldo et al. 2010). It is no surprise that the dynamic nature of food insecurity persists in rural population of Ethiopia where livelihood is derived mainly from agriculture, which is rainfall dependent and highly erratic. As such, it is important to analyze VFI and identify households that are currently food insecure and those likely to be food insecure in the near future. A proper approach to this would be to carry out a more disaggregated analysis of VFI rather than merely categorizing households as either food secure or food insecure. This is particularly important if the aim is to design and implement inclusive food security policies and strategies that are intended to serve different groups. This also implies that food security studies that aim to inform the formulation and implementation of policies and programs to address VFI should be based not just on the assessment of households’ current conditions, but also on the expected situation of access to food in the near future (Capaldo et al. 2010). In addition, although the emphasis is on analyses of dynamic nature of food insecurity for better and effective policy action, most of the past studies have focused on vulnerability to poverty, not food insecurity (Scaramozzino 2006; Chaudhuri 2003). Most food security strategies and program studies conducted in Ethiopia focus on the evaluation of current food insecurity with respect to who is currently food insecure and why (Agidew and Singh 2018; Bogale and Shimelis 2009; Motbainor et al. 2016; Jaleta et al. 2018). They do not go further and attempt to determine who are likely to be VFI in the near future. Therefore, this paper analyses households’ VFI and its influencing factors using the vulnerability as expected poverty (VEP) approach. Thereafter, implications for effective policy interventions to enhance food security and reduce the VFI in the study areas are drawn.",14

Exchange rate changes impact the production level of industries through trade channel effects and variation of the prices of inputs and outputs. Moreover, production is a building brick of an economy, makes industrial production index (IPI) essential for the U.S. capital market as well. The presence of a positive and significant relationship between the Dow Jones index and IPI in the U.S. has been recognised in the literature (Jareño and Negrut 2016). Movement in Dow JonesFootnote 1 exhibits the movement of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Therefore IPI works as a benchmark of how the U.S. capital market performs. The present study provides an empirical analysis to find out the impact of USD exchange rate on the production of selected U.S. sectors. In analysing the impacts of the exchange rate, we account for the existence of non-linear impacts of the USD exchange rate. By considering the non-linearities, our analysis is intended to capture the full effect of exchange rate movements. The adopted model enables us to capture short-run and long-run effects of positive and negative changes of exchange rate on industrial production in several sectors of the U.S. economy. Our hypothesis in this model is that there are non-linear effects of exchange rate on the production due to some level of import contents of exports. Our first contribution to the existing literature is that we suggest consideration of non-linear framework to measure the effects of exchange rate on the production of U.S. sectors due to the role of import content of exports. Secondly, we provide new empirical evidence of non-linearities in the relationship between USD exchange rate and industrial production in several sectors of the U.S. economy. It is widely acknowledged that the depreciation of currencies helps to boost exports and outputs. Based on this idea, governments can intervene in the market by depreciating currencies to gain international market and increase employment. Existing literature assume a linear relationship between exchange rate changes and output. That is, if depreciation is expansionary, appreciation is contractionary. However, it is possible that exchange rate changes to have ambiguous effects on production. In order to develop the notion of non-linearity, we rely on the ratio of import content of exports by each sector. The main idea that justifies the existence of such ambiguous effects is the dependency of industrial production on imports. Due to existence of some level of import content of exports, there could be non-linear effects of exchange rates on production. Therefore based on this idea, depreciation is expansionary, and appreciation is contractionary by having cheaper and more expensive exports, respectively. The opposite can be argued by having more expensive imports and cheaper imports respectively. For our empirical analysis, we selected eight sectors: consumer goods, business equipment, non-energy materials, energy materials, durable manufacturing, non-durable manufacturing, mining and electricity. This selection is based on the priorities for our model such as availability of appropriate monthly production data or suitability of the available data for our consideration. This paper is motivated by the nature of trade and production in these sectors and how exchange rate changes impact trade flows. First, we are interested in the import content of exports. The degree for import content of exports can facilitate the ambiguous effect of exchange rate on production in these sectors. Further, demand elasticities of inputs and outputs is another factor that might explain the nexus between exchange rate changes and production in these sectors. The elasticities of inputs in the U.S. is affected by the nature of the goods produced (necessities vs veblen goods). These factors along with others that affect the production in each sector will be used in the analysis of the results. According to OECD (2012), the import content of exports is defined as the degree of vertical specification. In other words, the import content of exports can be outlined as the contribution of imports in the production of exports of goods and services OECD (2012). Figure 1 shows the import content of exports for fifteen industries. The bar charts presented in the figure are based on (OECD 2012). Figure 1 reports data for three periods of mid-1990s, early 2000s and mid-2000s for 14 industries. In Fig. 1, the first group from the left represents mining. The second and third group are the sectors in consumer goods, the fourth group represents a significant portion of non-energy materials. The next three groups (5th, 6th and 7th) are components of non-durable manufacturing. Lastly, groups 8 to 12 represent durable manufacturing while groups 13 and 14 are classified as part of business equipment. (OECD 2012) Import content of exports (fraction of 1) We find that (1) USD exchange rate appreciation and depreciation both have positive effects on the production of non-energy materials with a significant but not high import content of exports, although the amount of effect for appreciation is higher than that of depreciation (2) the exchange rate appreciation has positive effects on production in the sectors with high import content of exports, (3) the exchange rate depreciation has positive long-run effects on production of consumer goods with close to 0 import content of exports, (4) the exchange rate changes do not play a significant role in the production of sectors that their output prices are controlled by other factors or demands are price inelastic. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the literature review and discusses the existing literature relating to the present study. Section 3 develops the methodology by discussing the economic model, data and assumptions. The results are brought forth in Sect. 4. In this section, we provide tables that summarise the empirical results from the analysis. Lastly, Sect. 5 offers concluding remarks and recommendations.",2

A number of empirical studies have investigated the validity of Great Moderation. A vast majority of these papers have focused on US. For instance, Kim and Nelson (1999) (for 1953–1997 period), McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) (for 1953–1999 period) and Chauvet and Potter (2001) (for 1959–2000 period) are among the studies that provide empirical support in this context. With regard to studies on other countries, Hakura (2007) and Coric (2012) have investigated this issue for a broad range of countries, respectively for 1970–2003 and 1961–2007 periods. Both studies found evidence of declining volatility in most of the countries. Buch, Doepke and Pierdzioch (2004) analyzed the issue for Germany and found declining volatility after the unification of East and West Germany. More recent studies have analyzed whether great moderation ended due to volatility observed during the global financial crisis in 2008/2009 that was triggered by malfunctioning of mortgage credit markets in US (Clark 2009; Darné et al. 2018). In the theoretical literature, sources of the great moderation have been heatedly discussed. Several hypotheses have been put forward. First, termed as inventory hypothesis, improvement in inventory management, just in time production and digitalization of economy is referred to as the major source of output smoothing (Zarnowitz and Moore 1986; McConnell and Perez-Quiros 2000; Owyang et al. 2008; Kahn et al. 2002) Second, success of the FED (Federal Reserve Board)’s monetary policy in creating price and financial stability using proper tools such as money supply, interest rate, fine tuning and management of expectations efficiently has contributed significantly to the stabilization (Taylor 1999; Boivin and Giannoni 2006). Third, termed as good luck hypothesis, simple smaller random shocks that occurred in costs, energy and commodity prices after the oil crisis (1970s) might have created such a moderation (Ahmed et al. 2004; Carlino et al. 2003;  Owyang et al. 2008; Stock and Watson 2002, 2003, 2005). In this study, we investigate the current validity of Great Moderation for OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) economies. The period of analysis runs from 1962Q2 to 2018Q3. The addressed research questions are as follows: (i) is the Great Moderation still valid? and (ii) is there any other output moderation/amplification after the global financial crisis in 2008/09? We hypothesize that the global financial crisis (2008/09) might have been highly influential on the volatility patterns. This might happen because countries took high precautionary actions after 2009 against the speculative fluctuations. Government policies became more regulatory; interventions have been set to limit free fluctuation of economic/financial variables. Particularly, in banking and real estate sector, the regulations have been increased. Uncontrolled credit lending and artificially created asset price bubbles are avoided. Monetary and fiscal policies are successfully designed in a way to minimize the cyclical swings. Central banks take policy actions with great precaution, such that policy shocks such as unanticipated monetary expansion, too low interest rates are avoided. Moreover, in the last decade, the world has been experiencing a technological revolution with a sudden increase in the productivity driven by the advancement of artificial intelligence systems. All these might have led to increase in productivity and great stabilization of output in the most recent period. Our dataset covers aggregate OECD cycle and 26 member countries. In terms of methodology, it has mainly been used as the measures of conditional and unconditional volatility and algorithms of structural break detection, namely, Inclan and Tiao (1994) procedure and ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model) (Engel 1982). Novelty of the paper comes from the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it represents one of the first attempts to analyze the post-crisis (2008/09) period and shows evidence for another Great Moderation that occurred at about 2010Q1. The period after this break date is characterized by much stable output evolution. Also, the possible reasons for such a new moderation are discussed throughout the text. The organization of the paper is as follows: in the following sections, data and methods, results, discussion and conclusion are provided, respectively.",2

8.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,06 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-019-0170-2,"Governance, capital flight and industrialisation in Africa",December 2019,Simplice A. Asongu,Nicholas M. Odhiambo,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"This study examines the role of governance in modulating the effect of capital flight on industrialisation in African countries. It is motivated by three main factors, namely the (i) growing trend of capital flight in Africa; (ii) relevance of governance in dampening negative macroeconomic signals such as capital flight; and (iii) lagging position of Africa in industrialisation.Footnote 1
 First, as documented by Boyce (2012) who have provided an update on estimates of capital flight, over the past decades, Africa has experienced substantial capital outflows. For example, approximately 814 billion US Dollars (in constant of 2010 US Dollars) was lost by 33 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries during the period 1970–2010. The lost sum to capital flight is higher than foreign direct investment and foreign aid which during the same period stood at respectively 306 billion and 659 billion US Dollars. This mismatch is important because lack of finance has been established to be a principal constraint to the development of the continent (Asongu 2013; Adu and Asamoah 2016; Charles and Mori 2016; Nyasha and Odhiambo 2017; Amponsah 2017; Danquah et al. 2017; Asongu and Odhiambo 2019a). Second, good governance has been documented to, inter alia improve the efficient allocation of resources (Fonchingong 2014), consolidate the foundations of social change (Efobi 2015), decrease capital flight (Asongu and Nwachukwu 2017) and boost industrialisation (Nobuyuki 2010). Hence, this study is particularly relevant in the light of Africa’s lagging position in industrialisation. Third, compared to other world regions, Africa is substantially lagging in terms of industrialisation. The comparatively slow progress towards industrialisation in the continent has been traceable to a number of factors, including (i) poor skills, infrastructure and investment climate (Page 2012; Gui-Diby and Renard 2015) and (ii) shortage of the investment capital required to fund the industrialisation process (Tuomi 2011; Darley 2012; Tibebe and Mollick 2017; Nukpezah and Blankson 2017; Asongu and Odhiambo 2020; Asongu et al. 2019). As far as we have reviewed, there is currently no study that has investigated how governance modulates the effect of capital flight on industrialisation. Hence, the positioning of this study departs from the broader contemporary literature on capital flight in Africa. The strand of the literature closest to this positioning has established capital flight to originate from poor governance (Christensen 2011; Gankou et al. 2016; Asongu and Nwachukwu 2017). Moreover, whilst there is a substantial body of literature on governance (Musila and Sigué 2010; Kangoye 2013) and capital flight (Ndiaye and Siri 2016; Mpenya et al. 2016; Asongu and Amankwah-Amoah 2018) in Africa, we know very little about how governance modulates the effect of capital flight on macroeconomic outcomes. We improve the extant literature by focusing on industrialisation as a macroeconomic outcome owing to the growing relevance of African industrialisation in policy and academic circles (Asche and Grimm 2007; Tchamyou 2017; Diao et al. 2017; Ssozi et al. 2019). To make this assessment, governance indicators are bundled and unbundled. The motivation for bundling governance indicators builds on evolving paradigms in the conception, definition and measurement of governance (Asongu 2016). For example, it is inappropriate to employ the term “political governance” unless the variable underlying the term is a composite measurement of “voice and accountability” and “political stability/non-violence”. The positioning of the research also departs from contemporary African development literature which has largely focused on, inter alia: nexuses between finance, remittances and industrialisation (Efobi et al. 2019); remittances, the diffusion of information and industrialisation (Asongu and Odhiambo 2020); the importance of governance in development outcomes (Pelizzo and Nwokora 2016, 2018; Pelizzo et al. 2016); linkages between trade and industrialisation (Kaplinsky and Morris 2019; Oloruntoba and Tsowou 2019); green industrialisation (Okereke et al. 2019) and financial reforms as the drivers of industrialisation (Folarin 2019). The rest of the study is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the theoretical underpinnings and testable hypotheses. The data and methodology are covered in Sect. 3, whilst Sect. 4 presents the empirical results and discussion. Section 5 concludes with future research directions.",9

Most of these increases are expected to come from developing countries of which Ghana is no exception (United Nations 2011; Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). This situation would put upward pressure on agricultural land which is limited by the law of diminishing marginal returns. Hence, identifying, promoting and adoption of sustainable farm technologies are crucial to increase food supply and to address the challenges of environmental degradation. Simtowe et al. (2011) indicated that the adoption of sustainable agricultural technologies remains the route through which developing nations could combat poverty and attain food security. Conservation agriculture (CA) has been one of the techniques introduced to help mitigate depletion of soil nutrients, conserve water, minimize soil erosion, reduce land degradation and boost farm productivity (Halbrendt et al. 2014). CF was initially introduced in the United States of America (USA) and other developed economies for large-scale farmers. However, it is now implemented in many developing economies especially in Sub-Saharan African mostly by international donor agencies (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007; Giller et al. 2009; Mazvimavi 2011). Fundamentally, CA includes minimum tillage, crop rotation and organic soil cover (FAO 2012). Minimum tillage minimizes the risk of land degradation and retains the soil structure by reducing the intensity of soil disturbance. Tiwari et al. (2009) indicated that minimum tillage reduces both runoff and soil loss. In the US, about 35% of the total land area was cultivated with minimum tillage in the 1980s due to its ability to combat soil erosion (Haggblade and Tembo 2003). Intercropping, particularly with leguminous crops like soybean, improves soil fertility through the addition of soil organic matter, soil cover, and nitrogen fixation. There are extant of previous and recent literature (see Ajayi et al. 2003, 2007; Arslan and Taylor 2009; Mazvimavi 2011; Arslana et al. 2014) on the adoption of conservation practices. The CA has primarily been motivated by the need to understand farmers’ decisions to adopt sustainable agrarian techniques for rural development. Most of these studies on the adoption of CA, mainly as promoted in Ghana and other developing countries, focus on CA as a package. This consists of the following: reduced tillage or zero tillage, no burning (leaving crop residue on the field), rotation of cereals with legumes, intercropping with legumes, planting of soil cover, and dry season land preparation (CFU 2007; Arslana et al. 2014). Nevertheless, there is a traditional farming technique that was practiced after the exceptional drought of the 1970s (Abdo 2014). This conventional farming practice was considered as a form of conservation agriculture for soil fertility management, the “Zai” pit system, popularly known as the Zai technology. The Zai technology was developed by farmers in Burkina-Faso in the early 1960s (Reij et al. 2009). Since then, the approach has widely been promoted and practiced in Burkina-Faso, Mali, and Niger (Sawadogo et al. 2001). For instance, in 1984, a renowned farmer named Yacouba Sawadogo who significantly contributed to the invention of the technology began organizing semi-annual market days to promote the Zai planting pits (Motis et al. 2013). In 1992, another farmer named Ousseni Zoromé started a “Zai school,” training local farmers about this traditional technology. Motis et al. (2013) revealed that, by 2001, Zoromé’s network comprised more than 20 schools and 1000 members. Ali Ouedraogo also used a student–teacher procedure to train farmers who needed assistance in implementing this technology (Ouedraogo and Sawadogo 2001; Sawadogo et al. 2001). Through this knowledge exchange, the technology spread beyond Burkina-Faso to other countries like Mali, Niger and Ghana, where NGOs such as Oxfam and World Vision are currently promoting the technology in most of these countries (Reij et al. 2009). This conventional farm technology is designed to rehabilitate degraded lands, conserve soil moisture and improve farm yield. Zai is the term farmers in Burkina-Faso coined to refer to small planting pits of about 20–30 cm in width, 10–20 cm deep, and filled with manure. In English, terms such as “planting pockets”, “planting basins,” “micro-pits,” and “small water harvesting pits” are used to describe the Zai technology. The pits are spaced 70–80 cm apart resulting in about 10,000 holes per hectare. Hence, the Zai technology refers to small planting pits in which organic matter (manure, compost or dry biomass) is buried before planting the seed in those pits. The addition of organic matter improves infiltration and increases soil nutrient making degraded land available again for cultivation. The organic matter buried in the soil attracts termites and other soil insects, which help in maintaining soil structure. When maize or millet is planted in the pit, the seedlings are protected from wind damage. The Zai pits can hold water over 500% of the water holding capacity of the soil (Danjuma and Mohammed 2015). Thus, Zai is an indigenous-based technology used to manage the fertility of poor soils, particularly in drought conditions. The success of this technology during the period of drought in the 1970s reduced the high level of emigration since many were abandoning their land because of low yield (Reij et al. 2009). The technology was one of the breakthroughs in that era which led to its adoption in other Sahelian countries that receive relatively low levels of rainfall, e.g., Mali, Niger and the northern part of Ghana. One of the critical challenges of smallholders in the Northern part of Ghana is infertile, dry, fragile, relatively low and highly variable rainfall leading to farmers’ inability to produce enough to feed the family and generate much-needed incomes. As an effort to address these challenges, the Food Security and Environmental Facility (FSEF) unit in the Garu–Tempane Presbyterian Agricultural Station (PAS-G) introduced the Zai technology to farmers in the Garu–Tempane districtFootnote 1 and Binduri district.Footnote 2 However, the adoption the technology has been low in spite of its diffusion. Although Kohli and Singh (1997) stated that imperfect information, risks, institution, and human capital are significant constraints to the adoption of improved agricultural technologies; empirical evidence has proven that technologies vary in forms, and hence, there are changing factors that influence the adoption and adoption intensities of those technologies (Uaiene 2006). Assessing adoption and use intensity of such a drought-tolerant and yield-enhancing technology may serve as an empirical guide to farm-level programmes’ design and implementations in areas of agrarian practices and sustainable development. The decision of adoption is assumed to be two processes, the choice of whether to adopt or not (binary, coded as 1 for adoption, 0 otherwise), and the extent of adoption (continuous decision on the quantities or level of applications). These two-decision processes could be joint or separate. However, some studies (Gregory and Sewando 2013; Kehinde and Adeyemo 2017) used logit or probit to explain factors influencing the probability of adoption. Many other studies (Teklewold et al. 2006; Obuobisa-Darko 2015) in the adoption of agrarian studies have used Cragg’s double-hurdle model with a mere assumption that farmers’ decision to adopt and intensity of adoption is separate without any econometric test. On the other hand, studies such as Idrisa et al. (2012) and Danso-Abbeam and Baiyegunhi (2017) assumed that adoption and intensity of adoption are joint decisions, hence, employed Tobit regression models. These studies have methodological issues that might lead to misleading conclusions on the factors influencing adoption. Assessing the determinants of the likelihood of adoption alone using probit or logit is inappropriate since it does not provide the full understanding of the factors explaining the entire decision process of adoption. Moreover, assuming that the decisions are joint or separate without any econometric test can also be misleading. It is, therefore, essential for studies in farm technology adoption to apply an analysis of separate or joint decisions to help in employing the appropriate procedure to adequately capture the set of factors that influence the two processes. When the right set of factors is captured, we can make applicable policy guidelines. This study, therefore, contributes to the body of knowledge in twofold. First, it seeks to identify the determinants of adoption and adoption intensity of Zai technology in the Garu and Tempane districts of the Upper East region, Ghana. Second, it performs a rigorous test on which econometric technique is the best fit for the data. The inclusion of the diagnostic test of whether the two decisions are joint or separate is an enhancement on methodologies in adoption studies in the body of agrarian literature.",22

How can we explain the considerable unemployment differentials that exist at the moment between the USA and countries such as France and Germany? Do you think that EMU is likely to exacerbate the unemployment problem in Europe? (Snowdon and Vane 2005, p. 161). In relation to the questions above, Snowdon and Vane (2005) inquired about economic reasoning and policies of unemployment in the EU in their interview in 1998 with Nobel laureate, James Tobin. The economic laureate did not expect significant improvement from the EMU to the macroeconomic problem. Moreover, Tobin believed that efforts to tackle unemployment were mostly from individual EU countries, signaling that such country-specific macroeconomic policies will be altered, as the countries are governed under EMU. Following this essential dialogue, the current study suggests that individual EU countries are likely to prefer the past experience of their own macroeconomic policies than the group of policies set under the EU and EMU. If this hypothesis is shown to be valid economically and statistically, the implication is a phenomenon similar to Tobin’s articulation of certain structural problems that reflect hysteresis, which is a barrier to suppressing unemployment. However, in this paper’s inquiry, what does the hysteresis look like and how would statistical data capture it? Ball’s (2009) study is believed to be the leading investigation that explores unemployment in 20 developed countries based on the hysteresis theory. Ball’s theoretical view favors the aggregate demand side rather than the aggregate supply side to explain long-run unemployment. Specifically, Ball’s theory implies that unemployment is influenced by aggregate demand, whereby the natural rate of unemployment is influenced thereafter through hysteresis channels. This theory is distinguished from the literature that says aggregate demand causes only short-run changes in unemployment, whereas long-run changes in unemployment are due to supply-side events such as labor market frictions (Friedman 1968). In Ball’s perspective, the proposition of hysteresis is not intended to disprove recognized economic theories, and the aim is to improve understanding with respect to the underpinning of unemployment behaviors. Hysteresis, generally, means the dependency of a phenomenon on its own history. The current study’s first hypothesis is stated generally here in accordance with Blanchard and Summers (1986) and Ball (2009): if the actual rate of unemployment is higher than the natural rate, there exist forces that will pull the natural rate to the actual path, which is a long-run mechanism of hysteresis. However, in contrast to Ball’s argument for aggregate demand, this paper tests both supply-side and demand-side effects represented by fiscal, nominal, and trade-related activities. Furthermore, in the second hypothesis, this paper intends to quantify the long-lasting influences from these activities on unemployment. Following the hypotheses above, the methodology is focused on the pattern of actual unemployment rates, recognizing that the natural rate follows this pattern due to hysteresis. This study’s approach is to use data on EU countries, because this allows the hypothesis to be tested for a region aiming at political and economic integration. The implication is significant, because the EU policies need to take into consideration barriers from long run and persistent hysteresis effects. As a matter of fact, economists generally are not confident with the EU policies solidly to bring about political and economic integration, thereby signaling the reason for Brexit. From Alesina et al.’s (2005) study of country size and growth, the increase of EU member countries is asserted: on the one hand, this magnifies preference heterogeneity, and on the other hand, benefits of country size are downgraded due to economic integration. Specifically, Alesina and colleagues contend that the objective of the EU to achieve economic integration is a matter at the European level, while regional separatism seems to be more apparent in some member states. Taking fully the acquis, communautaire of the EU is believed to be a major challenge to those Associated Countries (ACs), because the ACs could face inflationary pressure following the real appreciation of exchange rate during the transition process, where flexibility in the exchange rate regime is required to address inflationary pressure (Daviddi and Ilzkovitz 1997). Daviddi and IIzkovitz assert that the transition period is important to prepare the ACs to participate in the EMU. Some countries have shown remarkable efforts toward macroeconomic stability policies. However, Europe will only be a union of independent countries (Alesina and Perotti 2004). One argument for this position by Alesina and Perotti is that the concept of EU was initiated by a group of established economies which do not share the same secular history, particularly institutions and internecine wars. Thus, this encourages an emphasis on a balanced institution, which subsequently leads to the confusion of power among member countries. Moreover, Alesina and Perotti also postulate a potential clash in establishing a common market structure, because some regions (e.g., Southern Europe) prefer heavy government intervention in market activities, while other regions prefer a largely free market. Moreover, to gain EU membership, the transition countries are required to pursue costly transformation that can cause an upsurge in government expenditures, which could violate the requirement of 3% upper limit of budget deficit relative to gross domestic product (GDP) (Svejnar 2002). Svejnar asserts that the transition economies learned to adapt their government budget to local factors and mixed advice from western countries, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and EU; some countries also experienced increases in unemployment rates during the transition (this could be the effect of the countries suppressing inflationary pressure). In particular, the Public Opinion Research Center (1999) reported negative perspectives of many people in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland following political integration, despite that these countries were shown to be the most advanced transition economies in the EU. Dabrowski (2010) pinpoints the weakness of the EU in tackling financial downturn of member countries following the hit of the global financial crisis in 2008. The role as a union is deemed faded as nationalization of fiscal response was used by offering emergency packages to rescue members with financially troubled institutions. This approach generally produces “economic nationalism,” which Dabrowski articulates to be multifold: cross-country financial contagion happens at different speeds and strengths, responses of individual economies to financial shock are uneven, uneven rescue capacity and resources, panic reactions at the national level, and free-riding temptation. The postulation above implies the need for more research knowledge with respect to the EU’s economic experience. Using panel-data analysis with dynamic and structural specifications, this paper’s methodology is based on the EU to obtain important knowledge pertaining to the distant past economic experience and possible long-lasting influences into the future, arguably two hypotheses that have not been explored. The following section explains the theoretical proposition, to which this paper deploys analogical reasoning in favor of the hysteresis concept.",1

From the theoretical perspective, a large and growing fiscal deficit would lead to a worsening of the current account and appreciation of the real exchange rate. From a policy standpoint, determining whether the fiscal balance is on a sustainable path over time is important because the reply to this inquiry may indicate the requirement for policy reform before the imbalances become insolvent and lead to a hard landing. On the other hand, measuring sustainability of the fiscal deficit has been a highly contentious issue. Recent advancements in time series techniques, notably nonlinear modeling, allow analysts to re-examine the fiscal process and determine whether the fiscal balance is on a sustainable path. After the financial crisis of 2008–2009, the public debt of many countries has been on a steep upward trajectory due to implementation of various stimulus and relief packages directed toward financial sector and the economy as a whole. In fact, some European countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy are actually in serious dilemma with their public finances, which is reflected in the high yield demanded from the government bonds of these countries. As far as Algeria is concerned, the fiscal and external balances have deteriorated significantly due to higher spending and lower hydrocarbon revenue (The impact of the oil price shock since 2014). The fiscal deficit has widened significantly during the last 5 years, as it moved from the 1.2% of GDP in 2011 to 13.5% in 2016 (45.3% of NHGDP). To meet large financing needs over the medium term with savings in the FRR near the statutory floor of DA 740 billion, Algerian authorities launched a domestic debt issue in first April 2016 as it seeks to diversify financing sources and also aimed at mobilizing savings in the informal sector. The debt, with a maturity period of 3–5 years, will carry an interest rate of 5.0–5.75%. Despite all the available means, the public authorities have succeeded in attracting only 400 billion dinars, or the equivalent of $ 3.6 billion (36% of the value must be collected). While this process aimed to recruit financial resources of up to $ 10 billion (It is the one-third of budget deficit which was estimated at $ 30 billion). As a result, central government debt has increased significantly to 27% of GDP at the end-2017. In 2018, the authorities changed their economic strategy. They adopted an expansionary budget for 2018 aimed at clearing arrears and supporting public investment. Reluctant to borrow externally or let the exchange rate depreciate at a faster pace, they decided to monetize their financing needs and harden import barriers. The banking law was changed in October 2017 to allow for 5 years Bank of Algeria (BA) to finance directly, among others, the budget deficit, public sector debt buy-back, and the National Investment Fund (FNI). By the end of 2018, monetary financing may reach the equivalent of about 23% of 2017 GDP. In an environment where external risks remain tilted to the downside, this new strategy may further exacerbate macroeconomic imbalances as it risks increasing inflationary pressures. All of these challenges require us to ask the following important questions: First, are Algerian public finances meeting their intertemporal budget constraint? Second, is the sustainability of budget deficits robust to structural breaks and/or shifts in fiscal policy regimes? Third, is there any evidence of asymmetric and/or nonlinear fiscal adjustment back to equilibrium? And what is the speed of the process of fiscal consolidation? In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyze the technical basis of financial soundness and state solvency, and provide some evidence on the sustainability of budget deficits in Algeria, especially when fiscal policy is conducted as a nonlinear process, which has been hardly treated in the literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section two deals with the theoretical foundation of fiscal sustainability, whereas a descriptive analysis of fiscal framework considerations in Algeria is presented in section three. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in section four. Section five focuses on the methodology used as well as the main results. The last section proposes some conclusions and recommendations for decision-makers.",3

Moreover, cotton is the crop which produces many byproducts, such as, lint, edible oil, and cloths; these finished items of the crop have 10 percent shares in the GDP of Pakistan. The most notable point is that in the international market, India is trailing to the United States of America, whereas Pakistan instead to export, importing the cotton due to decrease in its area under the crop (World textile information report 2017, USDA annual gain report 2017). There is no denying the fact that Pakistan and India are the two major producers of cotton in South Asia. However, for the last many years, Pakistan has been facing daunting challenges like the cropped area of cotton has substantially minimized in the country. Despite having similar topography, physiography, and even having lower yield kg per hectare in India, the country has become an eminent player of the raw cotton, yarn, lint, and in, textile (readymade apparel industry) in the world. India is the second biggest country in the world which owns a huge tract of fertile agriculture land, so, the country has a comparative advantage in terms of cotton area under cultivation. The crop occupies (7.86) million ha area of Pakistan, and (9.88) million hectares area of India is under the cultivation of cotton. Pakistan and India both of the countries have tropical and sub-tropical areas where cotton is being grown; also, the soil structure is the same in two of the countries. Apart from this, the yield of cotton in sub-continent: Pakistan and India are 1.5–2 percent lower than to rest of the world, even irrigated area of the countries is lagging behind in terms of lint per hectare from the rain-fed cotton growing areas of the world. However, despite these shortcomings, India has espoused as the leading producer and consumer of the crop since 2011–2012, because 27 percent of the world cotton supply comes from India (economic survey of Pakistan 2016–2017). It is true that the area under cotton is declining in Pakistan since 2004–2005; unfortunately, this situation has been aggravating since 2013–2014, and by the ongoing year, 14.2 percent sowing area of the crop has decreased. Before 2014–2015, it was 2.902 million hectares, which is currently 2.489 million ha where cotton is been cultivated in Pakistan. The prime causes of decline in crop yield kg per hectare and decline in area are pest infestation, unskilled farming practices, and introduction of less of environment friendly and uncertified (GMO) seed for local cultivation, agriculture statistics of Pakistan (2011), economic survey of Pakistan (2017–2018). India is facing similar challenges; besides this, at present, India yield kg per hectare is 504 kg/ha, whereas Pakistan yield kg is 730 kg/ha and the country has produced 10,671 million bales. Contrast to Pakistan, India has produced 28.5 million bales, which is up to 5.6 percent more than previous years by 12.3 million, besides the area under cultivation of cotton. In India, area of the crop has 13 percent expanded during (2017–2018) year compared to the previous year (2016–2017). Since 2015, India has been the world largest producer of cotton, world’s second consumer 7th importer, third biggest exporter, and third country of the world, which has ending stalk. Contrast to India, Pakistan is the world 5th producer, third biggest consumer, sixth importer, whereas Pakistan has not been exporting raw cotton since 2010, Pakistan is the fourth country which ends up ending stalk (USDA cotton outlook 2019). Although India has a comparative advantage in terms of area, but the Indian population has reached to its steady state, and hence, its demand for apparel has increased to manifold. Therefore, the situation demands that if the only area is the reason for higher production in India, then what measures Pakistan can take to compete with its neighboring competitor to maintain its equilibrium in the international market. For this reason, technological advancement, adoption of the innovative technique, and speed of learning skill are critical to know. Therefore, the study is being conducted, because no prior comparative analysis is available which did ever measure the technological advancement impact on the countries in terms of comparative analysis of productivity of cotton. Besides that, it is imperative to know which country’s farmers are more progressive in terms of technology adoption and to learn knowledge-based skills. As in long terms, it will enable Pakistan to counter with the supply and demand gap effectively. Since the advent of Meiji revolution (1878), it had widely been assumed that high yield variety genetically modified seeds increase the crop productivity substantially, Fatima et al. (2016), as it did in Japan and later on in Korea and Taiwan. The study will investigate the following question’s answer: What are the major reasons, due to which area of the crop is shrinking in Pakistan? Whether Indian cotton growers are more progressive or Pakistan’s growers? The subsequent section of the study is organized in this way that (Sect. 2) deals with methodology and a detailed description of the variables. Finally in Sect. 3, we discussed results of ADF and ARDL: autoregressive distributed lagged model, and in the end, we conclude the study results besides suggested policies and framework to mitigate the problem of recent phenomena of lower growth of cotton.",34

For some authors, see, e.g., Amiti and Konings (2007), and Goldberg et al. (2010), the access to imported intermediate goods allows for quality improvement in manufacturing products and broader participation of a country in international trade. Their viewpoint rests on the arguments that the increased availability of imported inputs may facilitate product diversification and trigger pro-competition effects, inducing cost reductions and quality improvements in the final product. But for other authors such as Blecker and Ibarra (2013), Moreno-Brid (1999, 2002) and Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2004) the reliance on a strategy based on foreign content of export may be harmful to growth. While for Moreno-Brid (1999, 2002) and Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2004) such strategy may result in an increase in the income elasticity of demand for imports without a compensating effect on the income elasticity of exports, Blecker and Ibarra (2013) have argued that it may lead to a shift in the composition of imports (i.e., structural change) toward a higher share of intermediate goods. If this is the case, then a country that relies on imports of intermediate input may experience lower growth rates consistent with balance-of-payments (BoP) equilibrium. This kind of reasoning follows straight from the balance-of-payments-constrained growth (BPCG) hypothesis, which considers that a country long-run growth rate can be approximated by the ratio of the export and import income elasticities multiplied by the growth rate of foreign income (see Thirlwall 1979; Perraton 2003).Footnote 1
 To assess a strategy based on imports of intermediate goods, we follow two contributions to the disaggregated view of the BPCG hypothesis. The first is the multisectoral Thirlwall’s law—MSTL hereafter—advanced by Araujo and Lima (2007). According to that view, the export and import elasticities may be considered as an averaged mean of sectoral export and import elasticities, respectively, being the weight of each sectoral elasticity the share of each sector in trade. With such derivation, the authors have shown that even if sectoral elasticities and world income growth are constant, a country can grow faster by either increasing the share in exports of sectors with a high-income elasticity for exports or decreasing the share in imports of sectors with a high-income elasticity for imports. Such range of view, which points to the connections between economic growth and structural change, has been confirmed by studies showing that countries that relied upon strategies based on export-led structural changes such as the East Asian countries succeeded in catching up (see, e.g., McMillan and Rodrik 2011).Footnote 2
 The second approach is due to Blecker and Ibarra (2013) whose contribution aims to give more realism to the BPCG hypothesis by considering explicitly the imports of intermediate goods. The authors found that while an increase in foreign content of exports may enhance the growth of manufactured exports, they affect negatively the rate of output growth consistent with BoP equilibrium. But the final answer, namely if the strategy is beneficial or not to growth, is an empirical question that has to be addressed ‘with a model that adequately incorporates the key role of intermediate imports in relation to the country’s manufactured exports’ (see Blecker and Ibarra 2013, p. 37). To carry out their analysis, they have considered two types of exports (manufactured and primary commodities) and two types of imports (intermediate and final goods). Notwithstanding providing a pioneering contribution in this matter, they have made some stringent assumptions, namely: (1) fixed number of sectors, with the export structure considering just two kinds of sectors, namely manufactured and primary commodities, (2) imports and import-competing domestic goods having the same price, and (3) the growth rate of exports of the primary goods and their price growing at an exogenously given rate. A common thread of these two contributions, namely Blecker and Ibarra (2013) and Araujo and Lima (2007), is the acknowledgment that any strategy that affects the structure of the economy may have an impact on the growth performance. To go a step further in establishing connections between these approaches, we intend to extend the Blecker and Ibarra (2013) analysis by relaxing some of their hypothesis in accordance with the derivation of the MSTL. Such derivation becomes essential insofar as, over the last 2 decades, the production pattern has shifted toward the split of production stages among several producers accompanied by increased trade in intermediaries. Here following the Araujo and Lima (2007) approach, we present a fully multisectoral version of the BPCG model in the presence of intermediate inputs.Footnote 3 The main result that accrues from this derivation is that the BPCG rate is lower in the presence of foreign content of exports. In order to check the robustness of this result from an empirical viewpoint, we have focused on the Mexican economy pre- and post-liberalization period and have compared the estimates obtained from the original MSTL with the one derived here considering foreign content of exports. To estimate sectoral elasticities, we have adopted the log versions of the series in level (see Gouvea and Lima 2010) with data from COMTRADE, which allows us to test the extended model considering six export and import sectors. We employed the Johansen methodology that allows us to consider cointegration of I(1) series (see, e.g. Johansen and Juselius 1990; Moreno-Brid 1999; Blecker and Ibarra 2013) to check whether the new version of the MSTL with intermediate inputs has a better predictive power than the original MSTL. The econometric results show that the former presents a slightly better fit than the latter when the case of Mexico is under consideration. Besides, by using estimates from the MSTL with intermediate goods we explain the decay in the ratio of export to import income elasticities that took place after trade liberalization, a result reported by some authors such as Moreno-Brid (1999, 2002) and Pacheco-López and Thirlwall (2004). But, to evaluate properly the differences between the two versions, we have also run numerical simulations by using the estimated elasticities to compare the performance of the economy in the long run. While the econometric estimates do not differ substantially, numerical simulations allowed us to conclude that not considering foreign content of exports can lead us to overestimate the BPCG growth rate, which can give rise to relevant distortions in the long run. The analysis presented here shows that a multisectoral analysis yields a more inclusive approach to the role of building a growth strategy based on foreign content of exports. If, on the one hand, such a strategy allows manufacturers to benefit from having access to varied and good quality intermediate inputs, on the other hand, it lessens the gains from increased exports, potentially leading to a tightening rather than a loosening of the BoP constraint, mainly if the intermediate inputs present high elasticity with respect to exports. The outcome, namely if such a strategy is beneficial or harmful to growth, is a question addressed in this paper analytically and empirically concerning the Mexican economy. Besides this introductory section, this article comprises three more sections. The next one advances a derivation of an MSTL with intermediate inputs, and Sect. 3 presents the econometric and numerical simulation exercises comparing the original MSTL (Araujo and Lima 2007) and the one derived here. Section 4 concludes.",2

Italy has the second largest public debt/GDP ratio, and it represents the third economy in the European Union (EU), so that its public accounts stability is crucial for the whole area (Brady and Magazzino 2017a). The main problem for Italy, however, besides its high existing debt on which it is paying high interest in absolute terms, is that its growth is too slow. Since the euro area was founded, Italy’s average annual real growth was 0.4%, just marginally above the lowest rate of 0.3% per annum for Greece and one percentage point below the mean value for the overall euro area. Italy’s low growth rate, in turn, can be attributed to several structural causes. The country has recorded near zero productivity growth for years, and businesses are often very small, focus on the domestic market, and invest too little in R&D. Major inefficiencies exist in administration, e.g. in the justice system, and capital intensity is too low, also because investment declined by as much as 30% after the financial crisis. This was recently exacerbated by problems in the banking sector, including as a result of poor investment decisions in the past and short survival rates of governments over a long period, which have led to frequent election campaigns and delays in economic policy. Time domain analysis is the most widespread approach in the economic literature to study time series. Through such approach, the evolution of individual variables is modelled and multivariate relationships are assessed over time. Another strand of literature focuses on the frequency domain. Wavelets analysis reconciles both approaches, in the sense that both time and frequency domains are taken into account. With this approach, we are able to differentiate between short- and long-run dynamics across the whole sample period. The wavelet transform is a powerful tool for the analysis and processing of signals and is extremely efficient in various fields of application, such as compression and denoising, and in general when dealing with non-stationary signals, as pictures. These are in fact characterized by long-term dynamics at low frequencies (backgrounds) also called trends, and short-term dynamics at high frequencies (discontinuity, edges) also called anomalies. The latter, although they occupy a relatively small percentage in the image, have a high information content and must therefore be adequately represented. The wavelet transform has several interesting properties: it is able to analyse signals with characteristics that vary over time, thanks to its good capacity for time–frequency localization; it provides a representation on different scales (multi-resolution representation); it is easily achievable through a filter bank. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies wavelet analysis to Italian data. The evidence sheds new light on Italian fiscal sustainability issue in the long run. Besides the Introduction, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the theoretical context and the survey of the literature. Section 3 presents the empirical results, while Sect. 5 provides robustness’ checks. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes and gives some policy recommendations.",18

Ejemeyovwi,Evans S. Osabuohien,Ebenezer I. K. Bowale,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"This study is set out to examine the influence of internet usage and innovation in enhancing human development in Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries. It tests the consistency of literature with the experience of ECOWAS countries, thus investigating the nature of the relationship between Internet adoption, innovation and human development. The objectives of the study are essential as the advent of Internet technology signalled the birth of a revolution that would later prove to be a difference maker between developed and developing countries. With the introduction of the Internet, geographical boundaries were broken, the interaction between people became easier and faster, trade became universal, and digital and Internet economies began to emerge. These spin-offs affected most areas of human endeavour. Many have argued that the pace of globalisation presently being witnessed would have been unattainable if the Internet technology was not invented in the 1950s (Competition Policy Review Panel 2008). The Internet has proved to be one of the most outstanding creations of man as it is often referred to as the eighth wonder of the world (Sathiaseelan 2013). Technology and innovation have been at the very core of human progress, thus impacting on the quality of lives of people across the nations of the world through the improvement of educational and health care facilities, accessibility and efficiency. With innovations in science technology, commerce, agriculture, and so on, the mortality rate across the world has reduced by about 50% between the years 1960 and 1990 (Hettiarachchi 2018). The turn of the twenty-first century signalled an unprecedented leap in the pace of innovation and technology adoption unlike any other time in history. From microchips to cloud computing, big data to internet of things, artificial intelligence to machine learning, nanotechnology to robotics, the world is at the edge of a technological bang that would further widen the gap between the economic powerhouses and laggards. Harnessing the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and innovations in order to leapfrog the stages of economic development has been a major development discourse in the last decade. It is difficult to dispute the fact that technologies and innovation have been major drivers of human progress (Karakara and Osabuohien 2018). However, the impact of technological progress though evident has left many people wondering about how effective technologies will be in promoting inclusive and sustainable development in underserved regions of the world such as Africa and East Asia. The rate of adoption of internet and information and communication technologies (ICTs) has proven to be instrumental in driving inclusive growth, connecting people in remote locations to market, improving access to education, enabling access to information, promoting innovation, improving citizens participation in the democratic process and enabling the rise of small- and medium-scale enterprises (Guerriero 2015). The countries that make up the ECOWAS members are not left out in this tide. The desire to improve the economic fortunes of Member States was the premise upon which Vision 2020 for the ECOWAS members was developed (Economic Community of West African States 2017). With the Vision 2020 aimed at raising the standard of living through conscious and inclusive programmes, Member States have committed to promoting inclusive development which would be reflective in the Human Development Index (HDI) of the citizenry. The academic debate on internet usage, innovation and human development is beginning with the existence of various paradigms. Some scholars have argued that the utilisation of the internet has played a major role in promoting conflicts and violence, thus allowing West African countries spiral further down the development ladder (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa-UNECA 2012). The proponents of this paradigm ride on the view of Joseph Stiglitz who stated that the way globalisation has been managed has led to growing poverty, inequality, hunger, deprivation, riots, massive unemployment and increase in the spate of conflicts in the developing world (Stiglitz 2002). With internet adoption being an offshoot of globalisation, internet usage could spur instability. On the other hand, the question is asked: Does the relationship between internet usage, innovation and human development (individually or wholly) imply correlation, causality or mutuality? Mobile technology’s relationship with inclusive growth in ECOWAS was observed to have a negative linkage (Ejemeyovwi and Osabuohien 2018) which is in contrast with the proposition that ICT is likely to exert the highest positive effects on economic and human development landscapes due to its potential for wider and faster usage (Asongu and Le Roux 2017; Ejemeyovwi and Osabuohien 2018). ICT investment, however, was observed to have a positive and significant relationship with human development in ECOWAS. The present study observes further another dimension of ICT with the intention of capturing the innovation in the model to explore the nexus in ECOWAS, which forms one of the motivations of this study. The paper is structured as follows: A review of the literature was carried out, in the next section, to examine the various reports of researchers to provide the theoretical and analytical framework upon which the research is built. In Sect. 3, the paper uses the panel fixed and random effects model to analyse the data to examine the relationship among internet usage, innovation and human development in ECOWAS with a view to handling possible individual-specific fixed effect issue. Section 4 gives the results and discussion. Finally, the paper concludes by making recommendations on ways in which the ECOWAS sub-region can leapfrog the stages of development and drive human development and furthermore, inclusive growth through Internet usage and innovation.",37

This has coincided with the emergence of a number of new export-oriented services sectors, such as online gaming, and a pronounced expansion of existing ones, such as aviation services, which have had a significant impact on the islands’ main macroeconomic indicators (Grech et al. 2016). This followed the entry of Malta into the European Union, which meant that services firms locating in the islands could now access the single market. Exports of goods and services, in fact, grew by 67% in real terms over the last decade, such that they stood at 133% of GDP. This is the second highest ratio observed amongst all EU countries. However, the method typically used to compute contributions to economic growth have been suggesting that the influence of exports has been somewhat muted. For instance, in 2015, despite exports of goods and services rising by nearly half a billion euro—the equivalent of a quarter of all government current expenditure during that year—the contribution of net exports to real economic growth was deemed to be significantly negative (see European Commission 2016 and Central Bank of Malta 2016). This result was driven by the fact that during that year, there was an exceptional rise in imports of capital goods that more than offset the positive impact of the increase in exports. In a small open economy with no natural resources, like Malta, which depends on imports for a large part of its needs, the demarcation between what constitutes domestic demand and net exports is difficult to fix. The conventional approach which attributes all imports to exports ignores the fact that a very substantial amount of imports are consumer and capital goods or energy, all of which go towards domestic demand. Taking this into account would yield a truer decomposition of the factors driving growth and possibly provide a better guide to policymakers. In this light, this article applies a different approach to compute contributions to economic growth, which adjusts Malta’s GDP expenditure components for their import intensity. The next section describes this method and compares it with the conventional method. The third part of the article outlines the results for import intensities in Malta, looking at two different sources. This is followed by a discussion of the revised contributions to growth. The article concludes with some policy implications.",

At that time, it was argued by several researchers that although such imbalances were related (to one degree or another) to significant competitiveness divergences in the Eurozone system, exiting the single currency union would lead to vicious circles of currency devaluations, cost-push inflation, lack of capital inflows, monetary financing of deficits and recessions. Implementation of contractionary fiscal and wage devaluation policy measures emerged thus as a possible, although painful, way to tackle the ‘PIIGS crisis’. Indeed, as for instance De Grauwe and Ji (2016) remark, ‘since 2008–2009 quite dramatic turnarounds of the relative unit labour costs have occurred (internal devaluations) in Ireland, Spain, and Greece, and to a lesser extent in Portugal and Italy. These internal devaluations have come at a great cost in terms of cost output and employment in the debtor countries mainly because the expenditure-reducing effects of these internal devaluations were more intense than the expenditure switching (competitiveness) effects’. (p. 61). In addition, according to the International Labour Organization (2016, pp. 12–13), in 2015 the average real wage rates in Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain were still below the levels of 2007 (in Greece real wages have dropped by approximately 25% since that year). On the other hand, however, there were no processes of significant internal revaluations in the creditor Eurozone economies: ‘Thus, one can conclude that at the insistence of the creditor nations, the burden of the adjustments to the imbalances in the Eurozone has been borne almost exclusively by the debtor countries in the periphery. This has created a deflationary bias that explains why the Eurozone has been pulled into a double-dip recession in 2012–2013, and why real GDP has stagnated since 2008, in contrast to what has happened in the non-Euro EU countries and in the USA’. (De Grauwe and Ji 2016, p. 62). Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that, especially in Portugal, Greece and Spain, the possible rebalancing-price competitiveness effects of that ‘internal devaluation strategy’ were also negatively affected by: (1) the increases in profit margins and indirect taxes; and (2) the nominal appreciation of the euro from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2014. Thus, it has been argued that the observed ‘improvement in external balances is mainly explained by the collapse of imports in these countries, and this is a consequence of low relative demand and not of the (weak) improvement in competitiveness’. (Uxó et al. 2014, p. 1; also, see Myant et al. 2016; Bilbao-Ubillos and Fernández-Sainz 2018). At the end of 2014, the Eurozone inflation rate turned negative, while the subsequent announcement of the European Central Bank’ asset purchase program (on 22 January 2015), the so-called Quantitative Easing Program of 1 trillion euros, led to considerable depreciations of the euro against major international currencies. In fact, ‘between early May 2014 and end-May 2015, the euro depreciated by 23% vis-à-vis the US dollar and by 12% in nominal effective terms (against a basket of currencies of 38 major trading partners of the euro area)’. (European Central Bank 2015, p. 11). According to estimates by the European Commission (2015): ‘On average, a 5% depreciation of the euro’s NEERFootnote 1 increases import prices by some 4% after 1 year, with most of the impact occurring in just one quarter. By contrast, it takes around three quarters until changes in import prices are passed on to consumer prices and the response is generally small, as final goods prices incorporate substantial shares of domestically produced inputs (retail, transport, marketing costs). Yet, the extent of the response of consumer prices differs slightly across Member States, partly because of different consumption patterns (a high proportion of services in some countries, a high proportion of energy in others). On average, a 5% depreciation of the euro’s NEER leads to an increase in euro area consumer prices of about 0.3% after 1 year. However, as commodities are largely priced in US dollars and the dollar has appreciated strongly, the impact of recent exchange rate changes on prices may be larger than suggested by these estimates. Export prices in the euro area appear to be less responsive to permanent changes in the NEER than import prices. A 5% depreciation of the euro’s NEER lowers export prices in foreign currencies by about 2% after 1 year. The limited pass-through of exchange rate changes to (foreign currency) export prices may be partly explained by offsetting effects from higher imported intermediate input costs and partly by mark-up adjustments. […] [A] 5% depreciation of the euro’s NEER […] may increase real GDP in the euro area by around 0.3% in the first year and another 0.2% in the second year. […] [T]he impact on Member States’ real economies also depends on how strongly export demand responds to changes in relative prices. Empirical evidence suggests that price elasticities differ widely across countries and industries. For example, the price elasticity of Germany’s exports is estimated to be smaller than that of other large Member States (notably Italy and Spain). Through this channel, the depreciation of the euro may support intra-euro area rebalancing’. (pp. 51–52). All these facts and figures suggest that both medium- and long-run effects of wage and/or exchange rate changes on prices, income distribution and growth should be taken into consideration before the implementation of demand-switching policy measures. Thus, the purpose of the present paper is to provide empirical estimations of the said price and income distribution effects by focusing exclusively on the input–output configurations of Greece and Italy, i.e. two South Eurozone economies that are characterized, however, by different levels and structures of productionFootnote 2 and, at the same time, have experienced significantly different rates of wage devaluation. For this purpose, we use: Input–output data from the Symmetric Input–Output Tables (SIOTs) for the ‘pre-adjustment’ year of 2010. At the time of this research (September 2016), SΙΟΤs were available for the years 2005 through 2010. Input–output price models involving only circulating capital and competitive imports. These models are related to those introduced by Solow (1959), Metcalfe and Steedman (1981) and Katsinos and Mariolis (2012); nevertheless, their particular structures are imposed not only by the purpose (and underlying assumptions) of this paper but also by the available SIOTs, which provide no data on fixed capital stocks and non-competitive imports. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the analytic framework. Section 3 presents and evaluates the main empirical results. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",7

Romer (1986) established an endogenous growth model in which technological innovation was formed in the research and development (R&D) areas including human capital and the existing knowledge stock. Then, it was used in the production of all final goods and led to permanent rises in the output growth rate. Innovation is a significant factor of economic growth in the mind of various experts especially the policy makers. Moreover, innovation is not directly related to the amount of productive resources; therefore, it affects growth of the economy mostly through TFP. Technological innovation and non-technological factors are two main divisions of innovation, where new production and services are related to the technological innovation and non-technological innovations in the form of organizational or marketing modifications. However, growth level in itself can be attained by putting more inputs for process of production and through attaining higher levels of output with the same quantity of resources. There is no clear indication determining whether there is a casual association between innovations and economic growth through productivity or whether these both procedures occur at a time in developing countries such as Pakistan. Answering this query has critical relevance for Pakistan since unconventional answers lead toward different policy recommendations regarding innovation and technology policies. The objective of this study is to investigate how innovation and economic growth are interrelated to each other in Pakistan. How has the enrollment of TFP to economic growth changed over time in the expectation that shedding some light on the significance of innovation and showing a clearer picture of Pakistan’s economic growth? Using patent data (residential and non-residential) as a proxy for innovation, this paper gives support in the view that a growth in patents leads to rise in economic growth for long run. Moreover, at what extent, enrollment of TFP to economic growth changed over the time period and potential determinants of TFP? This study is employing annual time series data to fill the gap by providing up-to-date estimates of TFP and exploring the determinants of TFP (this study follows the traditional approach of estimating TFP growth using a production function) and contribution of innovation, in this manner detecting future growth engines for the long-run sustainable development in Pakistan. A significant conclusion points out the relationship between innovative capabilities, TFPG and economic development. This study has recommended some of important findings for policy makers such as, the combination of innovational activities, TFPG moving toward sustainable economic growth are essential and simulated policies are the best practice for significant contributions in economic development. The study is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the research methodology and data. The crucial point of this analysis is the decisive prediction that total factor productivity (TFP) growth has contributed significantly to economic growth. Finding from the prior literature, it can be found that these analyses give only indirect evidence of the role played by innovation on economic growth. Section 3 describes the empirical results and discussion. Section 4 finally draws conclusions and discussion with their implication.",53

Stone (1961) incorporated the IOT in the system of national accounts (SNA). One of the crucial elements in this was the introduction of the framework of supply–use tables (SUT). Nowadays, the situation is such that national statistical offices, such as BEA, compile SUTs, and that policy researchers, involved in planning and forecasting, use IOTs to do IOA. In this storyline, the compiled SUTs need to be transformed into IOTs. However, there are several transformation approaches, and these approaches yield different results. Thus, one concrete policy question may have a number of different answers, not for reasons of incomplete or imprecise data, but due to lack of a unique methodological approach. The debate has become known under the name “choice of model.” Key contributions in this debate include those by Stone (1961) himself, Ten Raa et al. (1984), Kop Jansen and Ten Raa (1990), Konijn (1994), SNA (United Nations 2009), Miller and Blair (2009), Rueda-Cantuche et al. (2009), Rueda-Cantuche and Ten Raa (2009) and Majeau-Bettez et al. (2014). Eurostat (2008) describes the most often used transformation models (labeled A through D) and some other transformation models, with illustrations on small numerical hypothetical tables. An overview of these main transformation models is given in Fig. 1. For convenience, we will follow the naming convention (A–D) of Eurostat as shown in this figure. Transformation of supply and use tables to symmetric input–output tables. Simplified after Eurostat (2008, p. 296) The main issue in the choice of model is the treatment of co-products. BEA’s supply table of the USA in 2010 in 61 × 61 resolution shows that the average industry produces more than ten products, which demonstrates that co-production is ubiquitous. Even though there may typically be a single primary product for each industry, the supply of many co-products by many industries does create a multifunctionality problem. When an industry has co-products, it is not clear which part of the labor inputs (and emissions) of that industry is related to the output of a particular (co-)product. Quoting Sraffa (1960) “For in the case of joint-products there is no obvious criterion for apportioning the labor among individual products” (p. 56). The different SUT-to-IOT transformation model essentially creates single-output systems, solving the multifunctionality problem using different assumptions on the allocation of co-products in a mechanistic manner. With the increase of the extent and detail of the SUTs, as witnessed by the advent of large databases, such as GTAP (http://www.gtap.org/), WIOD (http://www.wiod.org/), EORA (http://www.worldmrio.com/) and EXIOBASE (http://www.exiobase.eu/), this issue shows up more pervasively than before and the only practical solution is the application of the transformation model. The different transformation models yield different results, and these results are used for impact studies for policy on employment, innovation, climate change and so on. In addition, IOTs from consecutive years are used for econometric estimation, which again provide a basis for decision-making. Given the differences and the possible real-world implications, this paper revisits the choice of model problem, bringing in three new elements in the discussion. In the first place, it argues that the data in an IOT are not empirically observable, but that only some of the results of calculations made with an IOT are empirically observable, for instance, the total input of labor or the total CO2 emission. Thus, disputes on the “true” IOT are not amenable to scientific discourse, while disputes on results obtained with them are. In this positivist emphasis on the empirically observable results, we to some extent follow Rueda-Cantuche and Ten Raa (2013). We also build on a paper by Suh et al. (2010), developed in the context of environmental IOA (EIOA), where it is recognized that adding a satellite matrix containing environmental emission and resource consumption data shifts the attention from the total output vector to the vector with environmental extensions. We extend their argument to the traditional value-added vector, effectively bringing the discussion back to the economic domain via the detour of environmental accounting. Finally, we connect to Eurostat’s observation (2008, p. 310) that “it remains to be seen in empirical research which type of tables is the better option.” Secondly, we argue that a change in accounting units should in the end not affect the final empirically observable result, although non-empirically observable intermediate results may be affected by such changes. Here, we build on Dietzenbacher et al. (2009) and Weisz and Duchin (2006) who study the difference between physical and monetary IOT, i.e., IOTs that are expressed in physical accounting units (such as kg) and IOTs that are expressed in monetary accounting units (such as USD). A third line that enters our argument is that of environmental science, where scientists have developed their own analytical approaches [notably life cycle assessment (LCA); see Heijungs and Suh (2002)] and where a close comparison with IOA reveals interesting points of correspondence and divergence (Suh et al. 2010; Majeau-Bettez et al. 2014, 2016, 2018). We demonstrate that some of the established models A–D, described by Eurostat (2008), that have been understood as distinctively different approaches to convert SUT into IOT are identical when it comes to calculating empirically observable results (argument 1). We also demonstrate that some of the models are consistent with the requirements from dimensional analysis, but some others are not (argument 2). Finally, we strengthen the conclusion by Suh et al. (2010) that the models in LCA are comparable to the models in IOA and EIOA. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the status quo of the SUT–IOT debate and introduces notation. Section 3 discusses the different types of use of IOA. Section 4 repeats the argument from Suh et al. (2010), but with the focus shifted to economic analysis instead of environmental analysis, and adding more types of IOT transformation models into the discussion. Section 5 analyzes the effects of changing the accounting units. Section 6 analyzes to what extent use of transformation models A–D can be circumvented, thus connecting to the practice in LCA, where a consistent calculation procedure has been developed which not necessarily involves the detour to coefficient matrices. Section 7 provides an empirical case study as an illustration of the mathematical theory, including an analysis of the way sectors or products contribute to a result. Section 8 addresses the relevance of the result and discusses the issue of negatives, one of the traditional key ingredients of the debate on the choice of models.",

To achieve this target, it is into transcend the current fossil-fuel-based (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) technologies and shift to renewable energy systems. Neutral fuels or fuels free of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions must become the predominant source of energy, in addition to introducing energy conservation technologies in each sector of manufacturing, transportation, business, and households. Amid these developments, fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen production technologiesFootnote 2 are gaining much attention. The engineering team of our research group is developing a new hydrogen-generating system that directly decomposes hydrogen from methane and separates carbon as a solid substance with zero CO2 emissions. We evaluate the potential economic and environmental effects of reducing CO2 on the broader economy when the new system is introduced. Our simulation analysis estimates the impact of reducing CO2 in our new hydrogen production system and compares it with the current steam reforming method by applying scenario input–output analysis. In implementing this simulation analysis, we assume a certain volume of diffusion of fuel cell vehicles in the future and use it as a reference case for the simulation analysis. Broadly, several extended input–output models have been applied in the energy and environmental fields. According to Miller and Blair (2009), since the late 1960s, researchers theorized that the input–output framework could be extended to account for environmental pollution generation and abatement processes associated with inter-industry activity. Leontief (1970) provided a key methodological extension that has since been applied widely and extended further. In relation to CO2 emissions, there is accumulation of carbon footprints as Nansai et al. (2009), Wiebe et al. (2012), and Usubiaga and Acosta-Fernandez (2015). Cantono et al. (2008) present an assessment of the benefits of public transportation using hydrogen and fuel cell buses using environmental input–output analysis. The authors show that the process of producing hydrogen by steam reforming of methane does not reduce CO2 emissions completely, even though fuel cell buses do not emit CO2 during operation. They suggested the use of hydrogen in fuel cell buses as it is environmentally desirable, especially if accompanied by renewable sources, CO2 capture, or both. In contrast, using a framework of life cycle assessment (LCA), Bohnes et al. (2017) evaluated the environmental impact of passenger car fleet development in the City of Copenhagen for the years 2016–2030 and showed the relative environmental benefits from range-extended electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) over conventional vehicles and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Miotti et al. (2017) conducted a detailed LCA of the environmental impact of FCVs and other vehicles. They concluded that if fuel is sourced from renewable energy sources, as is the case of BEVs, FCVs have the advantage of lower greenhouse gas emissions over conventional vehicles. There are several methods to produce hydrogen.Footnote 3 Dincer and Acar (2015) examined various potential methods of producing hydrogen using renewable and non-renewable sources, and compared the environmental impact, cost, and energy efficiency. Photonic energy-based hydrogen production is environmentally more beneficial compared to other methods in terms of emissions, although costs and efficiency are not attractive. On the other hand, fossil fuel reforming and biomass gasification produce cheaper hydrogen efficiently. They concluded that hybrid-energy-based hydrogen production methods, in which the energy sources are electrothermal, photo-biochemical, and electro-photonic, have higher rankings on average.
 Keipi et al. (2018) compared the costs of producing hydrogen using thermal decomposition of methane to steam reforming and water electrolysis in the current and potential future market environments. They estimated costs from engineering-based information and not from input–output tables. They found that thermal decomposition of methane is suitable for on-site demand-driven hydrogen production in small- and medium-scale operations and economically competitive with steam reforming. Thermal decomposition of methane has the advantage of feedstock availability via the current natural gas infrastructure, whereas electrolysis is highly dependent on the cost and availability of renewable electricity. Our study is an environmental input–output analysis, focusing on the economic effects of new hydrogen production technologies. As reference, we consider hydrogen demand from fuel cell passenger cars bought by consumers and not fuel cell buses for public passenger transport. Further, we compare the new hydrogen production technology from methane decomposition to steam reforming. Electrolysis and other production methods are beyond the scope of this research because they have little advantage in production costs compared to reforming fossil fuels using current technologies. Our input–output model comprises a wide range of technologies to produce hydrogen for a single commodity of hydrogen so that the row number differs from the column number of the input coefficient matrix, which requires certain arrangement to obtain the Leontief inverse matrix. Here, we introduce a weighted average of the plural technologies. The weights, which are given exogenously as a scenario, indicate the choice of technology. Such studies appear in Ikeda et al. (1996), Yoshioka and Suga (1997), Wang (2016), and Fujikawa and Wang (2017). In some studies, we find the same characteristic of input–output models based on a rectangular matrix in which the row–column sizes differ. Nakamura and Kondo (2002a, b, 2009) and Kondo and Nakamura (2004) developed waste input–output model that was extended to the conventional input–output model by including waste generation sectors in the rows and waste treatment sectors in the columns. Since the number of waste generation sectors (rows) is larger than waste treatment sectors (columns) in the waste industry input–output table, a suitable method was proposed and implemented to obtain a squared input coefficient matrix for calculating the Leontief inverse matrix. Klein (1983, 2003) proposed a flow-of-funds model that is similar to Leontief’s input–output model. The flow-of-funds model describes that each economic agent owns several financial assets and liabilities. Tsujimura and Mizoshita (2003) and Nishiyama (2008) extended the scope of Klein’s flow-of-funds model by developing new approaches that convert a rectangular table to a square table for analysis. In engineering studies, we found another type of application for the rectangular input–output model. Tsunoka et al. (2011, 2012) investigated environmental burdens associated with a complex production system with some feedback flows. They described process activities with material input–output in the system as a rectangular matrix, in which one technique was presented to obtain the matrix inversion. Fukuhara and Hondo (2011) proposed a generalized method to describe a production system as a geometrical figure and construct a regular coefficient matrix using graph theory. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the study background. Section 3 outlines the input–output scenario analysis model, and Sect. 4 discusses the assumptions and analytical results of the scenario input–output analysis. The analysis results are summarized in Sect. 5.",4

This task can be formulated as a mathematical optimisation problem For this formulation, an arbitrary MRIO table \({\mathbf {T}}\) is vectorised into the vector \({\varvec{\tau }}\). The vector \({\varvec{\tau }}^0\) is the vectorised MRIO prior to the reconciliation process, and the optimal solution \({\varvec{\tau }}^*\) represents the final MRIO after the reconciliation. The function f is the objective function which measures the departure of \({\varvec{\tau }}\) from \({\varvec{\tau }}^0\) during the reconciliation process. The matrix \({\mathbf {M}}\) holds the linear mathematical constraints, and the vector \({\mathbf {c}}\) contains the corresponding external or superior data. The final table \({\varvec{\tau }}^*\) must adhere to the equation \({\mathbf {M}}{{\varvec{\tau }}^*}={\mathbf {c}}\). The vectors \({\mathbf {l}}\) and \({\mathbf {u}}\) contain upper and lower bounds for every element of the MRIO. Restricting the constraints set to linear constraints does not pose a problem in MRIO reconciliation, as most conditions that are posed on the MRIO table elements by superior data (such as balancing, adhered to sector totals, matching an aggregated table) can be interpreted as linear constraints. The formulation given in Eq. (1) also includes reliability data for \({\varvec{\tau }}^0\) and \({\mathbf {c}}\), given in the vectors \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{{\varvec{\tau }}^0}\), and \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{\mathbf {c}}\). We are following the interpretation of the reliability data as it has been proposed in previous publications [see, for example, Lenzen et al. (2010)]. That is, each element of an MRIO table is interpreted as the expected value of a normally distributed random variable, with the standard deviation being a measure for the reliability of each value. Hence, each element in \({{\varvec{\tau }}^0}\) is accompanied by a value for its standard deviation, and these values are pooled in the vector \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{{\varvec{\tau }}^0}\). The objective function f typically measures the deviation between the original unbalanced and the balanced estimate. From a mathematical viewpoint, it is usually the problem that defines which objective function should be used to measure this deviation. For example, in order to minimise the travelled distance between two arbitrary points on a plane, a standard Pythagorean distance measure is applied. If the ways on which one can travel across the plane are restricted, for example by a road, then the Pythagorean measure does not suit the problem anymore, and the distance between two points must be measured so that the possible pathways between the two points of interest are considered correctly. After all, one cannot walk straight through a building! Only once the correct objective function is found, an appropriate algorithm to find the shortest way can be chosen. This pathway towards finding the appropriate objective function for compiling MRIOs has been somewhat reversed: suitable algorithms were developed first, and their mathematical understanding grew in subsequent years. Over the decades, two mathematical approaches prevailed for the task of data reconciliation during MRIO compilation. These can be broadly classified as cross-entropy methods and quadratic programming (QP) methods. In this paper, we are proposing a new algorithm for a least-squares approach, which falls into the category of QP methods. The idea of using a least-squares objective function was first proposed in Stone et al. (1942). It was further developed into a fully quadratic model by Byron (1978, 1996) and van der Ploeg (1982, 1984, 1988), who also introduced error terms to control uncertainties [see also Harrigan and Buchanan (1984), Morrison and Thumann (1980)]. In order to motivate this function, van der Ploeg distinguishes between so-called soft and hard constraints in the matrix \({\mathbf {M}}\) and the vector \({\mathbf {c}}\). In the following, \({\mathbf {m}}^T\) describes the transposed of the vector \({\mathbf {m}}\), where the different \({\mathbf {m}}^T_i\) are the rows of \({\mathbf {M}}\). Each row in \({\mathbf {m}}^T_i\) in \({\mathbf {M}}\) and its corresponding value \(c_i\) in \({\mathbf {c}}\) represent one constraint. As a preparatory measure, the aim is now to identify for each row of \({\mathbf {M}}\) if it presents a so-called hard or soft constraint. The index s is used as the counter for the soft constraints, and the index h is the counter for the hard constraints. A row \({\mathbf {m}}^T_{s}\) of \({\mathbf {M}}\) and the corresponding value \({\mathbf {c}}_{s}\) of \({\mathbf {c}}\) are considered a soft constraints, if for the corresponding standard deviation \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{\mathbf {c},s}\ne 0\) holds (standard deviation for the superior data point is not zero). Consequently, \({\mathbf {m}}^T_{h}\) and \({\mathbf {c}}_{h}\) form a hard constraint if \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{\mathbf {c}},h= 0\). Plainly speaking, a soft constraint is a constraint that can remain unfulfilled (within the limits defined by the standard deviation), whereas hard constraints must be adhered to perfectly. Hard constraints are typically the so-called balancing constraints, which ensure that the final MRIO adheres to the condition that the total output of each sector must equals the sector’s inputs. Other data, such as national statistical data or international trade data, do not have to be adhered to perfectly, and this is represented by the positive values in \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{\mathbf {c},s}\ne 0\), which is the condition for a soft constraint. For example, the GDP for a country is never perfectly reliable, and a deviation by a few per cent does not render the final table as faulty. However, official statistics data should of course be adhered to as much as possible. The soft and hard constraints can then be pooled in different matrices, splitting the original matrix \({\mathbf {M}}\) into separate matrices. Let \({\mathbf {M}}_{\text {soft}}\) only contain soft constraints and \({\mathbf {M}}_{\text {hard}}\) only contain hard constraints. The vector \({\mathbf {c}}\) is split into \({\mathbf {c}}_{\text {soft}}\) and \({\mathbf {c}}_{\text {hard}}\) accordingly. Using this concept, van der Ploeg introduces error terms \(\varepsilon _s\) to the soft constraints, which account for the deviation from the corresponding value in \(c_{\text {soft},s}\). Van der Ploeg elegantly reinterprets these error terms. Let \({\varvec{\varepsilon }}=(\varepsilon _1,\ldots ,\varepsilon _S)^T\) be the vector of all error terms, then where \({\mathbf {I}}\in {\mathbb {R}}^{S\times S}\) is the unity matrix. Note that error terms are only applied to soft constraints. The hard constraints are introduced to this notation by where \({\mathbf {0}}^{H\times S}\) is a matrix with all-zero elements of dimension \(H\times S\), in which H is the total number of hard constraints and S is the total number of soft constraints. By defining Equation (2) can be rewritten as The elements of the MRIO, now represented within the vector \({\mathbf {p}}\), may also be subject to boundary conditions. The most common boundary condition is the non-negativity condition, which ensure that financial transaction in an input–output table can usually not be negative (with a few exceptions). Van der Ploeg defines the full reconciliation problem as Hence, the objective function that is used here is a weighted least-squares function, with the standard deviation values serving as the weights. Here, the hat operator \({\varvec{{\hat{\sigma }}}}_{{\mathbf {p}}^0}\) depicts the diagonalisation of the vector \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{{\mathbf {p}}^0}\). It should be pointed out that van der Ploeg’s formulation elegantly reinterprets the reliability values for the constraint values in \({\mathbf {c}}_\text {soft}\) as inverted reliability values for the error terms \(\varepsilon\). Note also that the error terms are unbounded, that is \({\varvec{l}}\in ({\mathbb {R}}\cup \{-\infty \})^N\) and \(u\in ({\mathbb {R}}\cup \{+\infty \})^N\). Note further that due to its construction the values in \({\varvec{\sigma }}_{{\mathbf {p}}^0}\) cannot be 0, and an inversion and squaring of the values as it is carried out in \({\varvec{{\hat{\sigma }}}}_{{\mathbf {p}}^0}^{-2}\) does not pose a numerical problem. This reconciliation problem fulfils the form given in Eq. (1), since the reliability data for both the MRIO elements and the superior data are considered.",7

Big corporations often issue these securities with a promise of good returns in the form of dividends, subject to satisfactory performance of the issuing organization. Frank and Goyal (2007) argued that the present performance of a company or an expectation of good performance has a direct impact on the share price. It is also a common claim among researchers that the economic climate of corporations is one huge factor that causes fluctuations in investors’ sentiment and ultimately induces share price behaviour. Every appreciation of share price is, therefore, an indication of potential gains for investors. When stock exchanges make decent trading facilities available to market participants, it facilitates smooth trading of listed equity securities (Gao and Kling 2006). Expectedly, a well-developed stock exchange increases savings by ensuring the availability of diverse financial securities to savers (Boubakari and Jin 2010). By doing this, savers’ portfolios are diversified, risks are effectively reduced, and capital is efficiently allocated to the most productive units of the economy. Apart from general risks and governance indices (Asongu 2012, 2013; Asongu and Nwachukwu 2016; Kirikkaleli 2016, 2020), a notable problem preventing stock markets from playing this important role in enabling economic growth is the existence of stock market manipulation (Aggarwal and Wu 2003). Market manipulation has always been suspected to pose a serious threat to market efficiency and substantially curtail its ability to effectively act as an engine of growth (Gerace et al. 2014), although empirical evidence to support this concern in the emerging markets is still scarce in the literature. Moreover, very few empirical evidence is found focusing on well-developed countries. We should notice that most of these empirical studies (such as Gerace et al. 2014; Aggarwal and Wu 2003) considered only how manipulation impacts stock market quality or efficiency. In Nigeria, similar empirical studies (such as Nurudeen 2009; Alajekwu and Achugbu 2012; Onakoya 2013; Brown and Nyeche 2016) have also advanced to present the link between stock market efficiency and economic performance. Meanwhile, the aforementioned studies failed to present a model that considers hindrances to stock market efficiency in the case of Nigeria. This study is expected to address these issues. It is interesting to note that the impact of stock market manipulation on growth is not a direct one. By illustrating stock market manipulation as a hindrance to market efficiency and then investigating the negative influence of a distorted stock market on economic performance, this research combines two different variables in a single study. The Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE), which was established in 1961, offers a platform for trading of shares and other financial securities (Nurudeen 2009). Over the years, this important role of NSE has facilitated the process of mobilizing funds from the surplus to the deficit units of the economy. As a result of this, a good number of corporations have been able to improve productive capacity and increase investment, an enabling environment for economic growth. According to Nurudeen (2009), the Nigerian Capital market consists of the primary market, the secondary market, and the second-tier security market. The Investment and Securities Act (ISA) accredited the exchange with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) expending resources to regulate the market activities. Among the regulatory responsibilities of SEC are detection, investigation and prosecution of manipulation cases, unfair trading practices and other activities that contravene the market rules (Aliyu 2014). According to Alajekwu and Achugbu (2012), there are 180 listed companies on NSE, with the exchange maintaining sectoral indices based on market capitalization methodology and also adopting the All-Share Index as a gauge for overall market performance. Over the years, the Nigerian stock market grew considerably both in size and liquidity. Until 2008, the stock market performance remained similar to that of many developed stock markets across the globe with the market indicators hitting a record high. For instance, market capitalization in 2007 (N13, 295 billion) had a quantum leap from its 1990 figure of N16.36 billion (Alajekwu and Achugbu 2012). Similarly, market turnover grew to roughly N2, 100 billion in 2007 from its 1990 figure of N0.31 billion (Brown and Nyeche 2016). The overall performance of the exchange, measured by the All-Share Index, was reported by Nurudeen (2009) to have climaxed the era of the stock market boom. The index peaked all-time high 57,990.2 points in 2007 from its low 1990 figure of 513.8 points. However, the impressive era of the stock market growth came to an end as a result of various sharp practices by the market participants. At the moment, the All-Share Index stands at 25, 339.39 points while the market capitalization is roughly N10, 160 billion (Brown and Nyeche 2016). Although the Nigeria capital market might be considered as young, it is among the fastest-growing emerging financial market in recent years. Aliyu (2014) opined that, despite the market showing a lot of potentials, investigations reveal the existence of various unethical and harmful practices that contributed to its collapse in 2008. Sadly, the Nigerian Stock Exchange failed to score high on integrity and the market was negatively impacted resulting in huge divestment from the country, continuous loss of employment and a lot more loss in tax revenues. Aliyu’s study revealed that some investors were, long before the global economic meltdown, worried by high valuations, insider trading, illegal sales of stocks by brokers, sales of non-existing shares to investors, diversion of returns on investors’ stock by stockbrokers, pump and dump. We should know that, even without the global economic meltdown of 2008, the overly pumped Nigerian stocks were a product of huge spread abuse and market manipulation of unbelievable magnitude and was headed for a total collapse. Consequently, this research aims to examine the level of Nigerian stock market efficiency at the post-manipulation period and its impact on economic performance. This aim focuses on answering the following questions: does market manipulation have a significant impact on Nigeria Stock Market efficiency; what is the trend in the relationship between stock market efficiency and economic growth in Nigeria? This research is structured into five sections. Section 2 contains a review of the literature on the contribution of the stock market to economic growth. Sections 3 and 4 entail data and methods and discussion of results, respectively, while section 5 concludes the research with policy implications.",7
9.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,24 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-020-00227-z,An agribusiness perspective of demonetization in central region of the state of Gujarat in India,December 2020,Ritambhara Singh,Mahesh R. Prajapati,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"On November 8, 2016 the Government of India banned ₹500 and ₹1000 notes (about 86% of the total currency in circulation, having value ₹15.44 lakh crores) to serve as a legal tender, a move what is technically known as demonetization. The notion found favors and criticism as well. The demand and supply of new notes led to decrease in demand for goods and services, widely affecting payments where paper currency was the only way. In this process, 97%, around ₹14.97 lakh crores were deposited in banks by 31 December 2016. This was not the first time when high denomination bank notes were demonetized in India. The Reserve Bank of India, country’s federal bank printed highest denomination notes of ₹10,000 in 1938. Thereafter, the government demonetized ₹1000 and higher denominations in 1946. In 1954, ₹1000, 5000, and ₹10,000 were re-introduced and all of them were demonetized in 1978 to curb unaccounted money. Further, ₹500 was introduced in 1987, and ₹1000 was introduced in 2000, to contain the volume of bank notes in circulation, due to mounting pressure of price rise. It should be noted that ₹2000 was introduced for the first time in Nov 2016. Also, the history of demonetization is not restricted to India only. Several countries have had their experience with demonetization. Most of them had common objectives of curbing black money and corruption. Table 1 summarizes the details of other countries that demonetized the currency at some point in time. The demonetization brought strong long-lasting positives and temporary negatives to countries it was announced in. The government of India took this decision on November 8, 2016 to curb India’s parallel black economy (counterfeit currency), corruption and funded terrorism. Though it was assumed that siphoning off 86% of the currency in circulation may bring with it the negative impact on India’s economy, the government promised that the growth will return to normal on the onset of remonetization. The secondary objective of the government behind demonetization was to accelerate the pace of digital transaction of money in India and move country towards a less-cash economy. According to the Economic Survey 2016–2017, about 78% of all consumer payments in India happened in cash. Agriculture is one sector which is almost fully dependent on cash transactions, as it is characterized by small and marginal farmers. There are many reasons behind the use of cash in India as compared to other nations. The foremost reason why cash is favorite with Indian population is that it is convenient, accepted everywhere, and its use is costless for all segments of the society. So those who are economically backward or even ordinary people find it easy to use cash. Furthermore, cash transactions are anonymous, helping to preserve privacy, which is a virtue as long as the transactions are not illicit. As mentioned earlier, Indian agriculture is characterized by more than 85% small and marginal farmers whose land holding vary between under one hectare and up to two hectares. Around 60% of the workforce is directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Most of the workers move to the urban area to work during off season. During demonetization, they faced difficulty to find work even in urban areas as the production activity slowed down due to liquidity crunch. Initial studies conducted by the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Ayog which is a policy think tank of the Government of India, and a few others stated that demonetization had no impact on agriculture and this conclusion was limited to only area sown under rabi crops. Aggarwal and Narayanan (2017) studied data on arrivals and prices of 35 agricultural commodities for the period 2011–2017, and focused on short-term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. They found that demonetization has displaced domestic agricultural trade in regulated markets by over 15% in short run, settling at 7% after recovery at the end of 90 days. Trade in perishables was displaced to the extent of 23% in the week following intervention, recovered, but was still 18% lower than usual. Most of this was due to decline in prices rather than arrivals, which appeared to have recovered in 3 months, the authors (Aggarwal and Narayanan 2017) concluded. Bisen et al. (2017) collected information from 40 farmers, 30 traders, and 40 consumers. The authors found that small and marginal farmers were most affected in contrast to large farmers in case of sowing, purchase and sale of agri output. Farmers dealing with perishables were more affected than those who dealt with grains. Wholesalers were more affected in grain markets and retailers in fruit and vegetable markets. Consumers used more than one mode of payment, but those with lower income and those who did not possess alternative mode of payments (e-payments) were affected most. The study found that all economic agents worked in the favor of getting normalcy at the end of February 2017. Chand and Singh (2017) analyzed agricultural growth amid demonetization within 7 weeks of intervention, on area sown, crop pattern, productivity and market. They found a delay of 1–2 weeks on sowing, but the pace later picked up. In fact area sown under wheat was higher by 7% over last year in December. Fertilizer offtake was lesser in December, but that too later picked up when government announced the acceptance of old currency notes. No effect was found on prices of major commodities that arrive in the markets regulated by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee. However, the payments were delayed due to cash crunch. Prices of some perishables like tomato crashed in December, due to glut. Level of productivity was assumed higher due to normal NW monsoon, resulting in 10% increase in kharif output. Damodaran (2017) found that good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. Farmers successfully weathered the demonetization storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments for labor, purchase of seed, fertilizer and pesticides. Prices were impacted. Potatoes in Farukkhabad in India fetched ₹350 per quintal in Feb 2017 as compared to ₹600 in the previous year. Onions in Lasangaon, Maharashtra, traded at ₹450 per quintal in May against ₹750–800 and ₹1200 in the same month of preceding 2 years. Farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, sold tomatoes in early May at ₹300–400 per quintal, down from ₹1500 to 1600 a year ago. Potatoes', onions', tomatoes' were wholesale priced at less than ₹5 per kg and their retail prices were within ₹20 per kg. It was noted that just a 10% output increase led to 200% fall in price. Kohli (2016) found that the input purchase was affected as many purchase were outright in cash. He predicted a shortfall in acreage and productivity, and further reported 25–50% drop in sales of fruits and vegetables across markets, due to demand suppression and timely transport issues, in lack of payments and withdrawal. Srinivas (2016) said that demonetization vacuumed liquidity from the virtually cash-only economy (agriculture sector). He, in his study, found that it was a myth that farmers refused to accept cheques. Small dairy farmers in Andhra were accepting cheques, pulses, fruits and potato contract framers were accepting cheques. However, FCI (Food Corporation of India) failed to pay in cheque to Punjab and Haryana farmers because it wanted to deduct first the loan repayment amount. Direct Benefit transfer for seeds was successful even among small and marginal farmers in Uttar Pradesh. Marginal and small farmers were hit the most and so were value chains with minimal processing. The biggest argument with cash was that it is most convenient and one need not to be literate or tech-savvy to use cash. The author suggested that there is a need to push reforms. Sumathy and Savitha (2017) found that farmers faced problems as they are highly cash dependent. Daily wage earners were earning smaller amount per day. Farmers were unable to pay to the laborers, leaving laboreres jobless for months. Farmers could withdraw up to ₹25,000 per week against their crop loans to ensure sowing of winter crops. Those with no Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) were affected. Disruptions and breaks in supply chains, as sales fell, increased wastage of perishables, and lower revenues. Chopra (2016) reported that consumption slowed down of impulse and non-essential items category. Milk did not experience the impact as government relaxed purchase of milk at designated milk booths using banned denominations. Beverages, especially the alcoholic ones experienced a slowdown in sales across board. Edible oil sector experienced slowdown. The slowdown in consumption was estimated to be more prominent in cash-intensive rural markets than their urban counterparts. None of the studies conducted, adopted agribusiness approach to understand the impact on system as a whole. This study attempts to assess the impact of demonetization from an agribusiness perspective. This study was conducted in year 2017–2018. The survey was conducted between November 2017 and December 2017. The study aimed to achieve the following specific objectives To study impact of demonetization on agribusiness sub-systems To examine farmers’ food purchase decision criteria during pre- and post-demonetization To examine the problems faced by farmers in the process of moving to a digital/cash-less economy.",1

Global imbalances began to widen to exceed 5% of GDP in 2008 from 2% in 1996. The most significant change was widening in the current account deficit of the USA from less than 2% of GDP in 1997 to 5.8% in 2006. The USA has started to run a current account deficit since 1992. In Europe, the UK, France, Italy, Poland and Greece are some of the countries have run current account deficits for some years during that period. Germany has run current account surplus between 2002 and 2014. In Far East Asia, Japan has run current account surplus between 1981 and 2013. The highest surplus in Japan was 4.9% in 2007. Similarly South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore have run current account surplus since 1998. China has run 20 years of surplus since 1994. In Far East Asia there is a significant amount of surplus during that period. In Latin America, Brazil has run a deficit between 2008 and 2014. Mexico has current account deficits since 1988. Escalating world oil prices may have also contributed to a change in the distribution of current account balances. For instance, crude oil price was around 16 dollars per barrel in 1994, in 2012 it increased to 112 dollars per barrel. Oil exporter developing countries have benefited from this price increment. As a result, the trade balance of some of these developing countries has increased significantly. This had a significant effect on the surpluses of oil-exporting countries. World surpluses have been distributed across five major locations since 2002 to until 2014: Germany, Japan, China, emerging Far East Asia and oil-exporting countries. Bernanke (2005) saving glut hypothesis argues the pattern of global imbalances in the 2000s reflect in part the flow of financial capital from emerging economies with under-developed institutions and financial markets and excess savings towards economies perceived to have more efficient institutions and financial systems like the USA. In the literature, several studies have examined the determinants of current account balances until now. The first group of studies have worked on the response of current account imbalances to shocks in just one specific determinant. The second group of studies have tried to identify the macroeconomic medium-term determinants of current account using panel data analysis. The last group of studies have tried to identify the institutional and financial determinants as well as macroeconomic determinants of the current account balances for different groups of developed and developing countries. Debelle et al. (1996), Freund (2000), Calderon et al. (2002), Chinn and Prasad (2003), Aristovnik (2006), Chinn and Ito (2007), Legg et al. (2011), Gruber and Kamin (2009) and Cheung et al. (2013) are some of the studies on the determinants of current account balances. There are different results about the effect of financial development in literature it is required to understand the effect better with extended time period after the financial crisis. It is also important to understand if there are new institutional determinants of current account balances with the extended time period. So a large number of institutional variables and macroeconomic stability variable are added to the study. This paper contributes and extends previous empirical studies by: One of the most comprehensive studies in terms of time period and the number of countries in the literature. The analysis is carried for 97 developing and developed countries in six different country groups for 28 years which also includes the time period after the 2008 financial crisis which most of the other papers do not capture. This helped to understand for each country group which factors are more important. All the countries with large contributions to global imbalances are added. Investigating the largest number of institutional factors in the longest time period related with the legal system, political system, political risks and stability, corruption behind current account balances for a panel of developed and developing countries which are identified by Bernanke (2005). New determinants, such as legal system and property rights, voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, political constraints which are represented with indexes, are identified. These factors are found to have negative and statistically significant relations for some of the country groups. Cheung et al. (2013) find a statistically significant relationship only with regularity quality and current account balance with a negative sign for the full sample. They were not able to find any relationship with political risks, voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law, control of corruption and political constraint variables. Chinn and Ito (2007) find a statistically significant relationship with legal variable which is combined of law and order, corruption and bureaucracy quality. Gruber and Kamin  (2005) find a statistically significant relationship only with regulatory quality and rule of law for some of the country groups. They were not able to find any relationship individually with voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness and controls of corruption. Voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, political constraint variables are tested individually and identified as institutional determinants of current account balances in a study for the first time. Although some legal system-related variables were found as determinants of current account balances in other studies, legal system and property rights variable is found as one of the determinants of current account balances for the first time in this study. It is not about the general quality of a country’s complete legal system, but measures specifically the degree to which a country’s legal system protects private property rights and to which its government enforces those laws. Extending the set of factors.For the first time, inflation rate (CPI) representing macroeconomic stability (in the form of low inflation) factor which is identified by Bernanke (2005), is added to the study. Macroeconomic stability is found to have positive and statistically significant relations with current account balances for three country groups. One of the macroeconomic factors, net average crude oil export per GDP is used in the analysis to measure the direct effect of oil dependency instead of production or consumption. It is found to have positive and statistically significant relations with current account balances for five groups of countries. Financial market development (as measured by the share of private credit to GDP) is found to have overall negative and statistically significant relationships with current account balances for all country groups without exception for the first time in a study. Gruber and Kamin (2009) are unable to find consistently statistically significant impact with current account balance and financial development as measured by the share of private credit to GDP. They reach a conclusion that different quantity of measures of financial development including private credit neither appears to influence current account balances in the expected direction nor did they help explain the large developing country surpluses or the outsized US deficit. Legg et al. (2011) are unable to find statistically a significant relationship with current account balance and stock market turnover (financial deepness). Cheung et al. (2013) find a statistically significant impact with current account balance only for the full sample. For the rest of the article, Sect. 2 discusses the potential factors behind the external balances, Sect. 3 describes the data and methodology, Sect. 4 presents the results, and Sect. 5 gives the conclusions.",11

Thus, while it is considered an optimal decision for governments to entirely rely on domestically generated revenues from taxes, public borrowing is at times sought to bridge the resource gap between tax revenues and expenditures (African Development Bank 2018). Thus, governments while it is an optimal decision to entirely rely on domestically generated revenues from taxes, public borrowing is at times sought to bridge the resource gap between tax revenues and expenditures. However, this has trapped many emerging economies into debt syndrome. Countries seek funding from international communities through loans, grants and donations. Domestically the government seeks public funding through issuance of treasury bills and loans among other modes. Even though this endeavor increases resource availability, it is a contractual liability and has to be repaid. In the context of this paper, public debt is defined as how much a country owes to lenders outside of itself. These can include individuals, businesses, and even other governments both internally and externally. It is usually divided into two; the external and domestic debt (Abbas and Christensen 2007). External public debt is the total public and private debt owed to nonresidents repayable in foreign currency, goods, or service. Government external debt is, therefore, the summation of current account deficit, increase in foreign exchange reserves and gross private short-term capital outflow less net long-term private capital inflow. Dereje (2013), however, defines external debt as that part of financial obligation in any national economy that is owed to a borrower outside the country; the borrowers can be a foreign country(s), International organizations, and corporations or private households. On the other hand, Domestic Debt is the amount of money raised by the government, in local currency and from its own residents. Generally, domestic debt consists of two categories, which are Bank and Non-Bank borrowing. Domestic debt in Uganda has been mainly used to finance deficits and implement monetary policy in many African governments so that it now constitutes a large share of the total debt stock (AFRODAD African Forum et al. 2013). Economic growth is defined as the total output (goods or services) produced by a country. In other words, it means an increase in the production capacity of the economy in terms of goods and services (Abbas 2005a, b). Economic growth occurs whenever people take resources and rearrange them in ways that are more valuable. Economic growth can be measured in nominal terms, which include inflation, or in real terms, which are adjusted for inflation, i.e., by the percent rate of increase in the gross domestic product (GDP). Economic growth measures growth in monetary terms and looks at no other aspects of development (Ayres and Warr 2002). In Uganda, economic growth has been relatively stable since the end of political instabilities in the 1980s. The government aspires to transform the economy from peasantry to middle-income status as indicated in the National Development plans I and II with optimal emphasis on infrastructure development in the form of roads, electricity and innovations. This has prompted the government to commit a lot of resources some of which have been solicited from foreign sources in the form of loans for such infrastructure. Uganda’s public and publically guaranteed external debt exposure as at end of December 2016, increased by 8.7% to US $ 10.5 billions from 9.67 billion at the end of December 2015. Also, by end of December 2016, the total external service amounted to US $ 69.3 million, of which 35.2% is principal repayments, 40.2% interest loan service and 24.6% of commitments (MoFPED 2017). Moreover for the years, the domestic debt has been increasing amidst little private sector credit. For instance, by December 2016, the total stock of outstanding debt stood at UGX 11,712 billion which is an equivalent of US $ 3.25 billion. Uganda budgets for the last 3 Financial Years (FYs) are predominately occupied by huge payments to debt interest rates, taking a high percentage compared to other social development sectors like health, education water to mention but a few. For instance in then FY 2017/18, debt interest rates took 12.2% of the total budget (MoFPED 2017). Therefore, if the situation persists, this trend may plunge the country into a debt crisis. However, it is not clearly known how the rise in the country’s public debt affects her economic growth especially for the case of Uganda. Thus, this study seeks to establish how the growth in public debt affects the country’s economic growth. This study is, therefore, a humble attempt to document the impact of public debt on Economic growth. Uganda has had a long history of debt. First, it was one of the countries to have benefited from HIPCs in the 1990s and MDRIS in which all her debts were canceled by 100%. However, recently, the trend of public debt has been increasing at an exponential rate more than twice the rate at which the country got the debt reliefs. Debt and its structure have a great impact on the functioning of the economy as a whole, thus a better understanding of its impact on economic growth will influence better policies on the prudent use of borrowed resources where necessary.",

Business firms nowadays specially giving significant importance to develop their human assets to gain competitive advantages over the other firms. Human assets are intangible in nature and generally not captured by balance sheet items. Accurate measurement of firm’s human assets is bit complex; one reason could be as Bontis et al. (2000) pointed out that human assets of a firm are not under direct control of the firm. In spite of knowing the fact that human assets are important in valuing the firm still most of the firm valuation are done considering only the balance sheet items. Collins et al. (1997) added investors could gain additional by gathering information on the firms’ human assets. Last few decades are spectator of several risk factors and factor models for firm valuations [see Maiti (2020a, b)]. CAPM [Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Mossin (1966)] was the seminal model that challenged over the period of time by several researchers like Fisher Black (1972), Fama and MacBeth (1973), Ross (1976), Banz (1981), Reinganum (1981), Gibbons (1982), Basu (1983), Shanken (1985) and Bhandari (1988). There after several multifactor models developed and challenged such as Ross (1976) APT model, Fama–French (1993) three-factor model, Fama–French (2015) five-factor model and others. Further studies by Haugen and Baker (1996), Cohen et al. (2002), Fairfield et al. (2003), Titman et al. (2004), Novy-Marx (2013), Hou et al. (2014), Clarke (2016), Chiah et al. (2016), Balakrishnan and Maiti (2017), Maiti and Balakrishnan (2018, 2020), Maiti (2019a, b, c), Maiti (2020a, b) and others find that these model are not global and there is a scope for more robust valuation model. Most of the studies discussed above do not include a measure for human assets in their valuation models. Notably it was the Campbell (1992, 1992) studies that strongly argued firm valuation excluding human assets may lead to serious errors. Other studies by Fama and Schwert (1977), Jagannathan and Wang (1996), Jagannathan et al. (1998), Rosett (2001) and Qin (2002) also find that human asset is an important factor in explaining the cross-sectional risk return variations. The present study will examine the role of human asset investment in firm valuation in Indian context. Present study will use Fama–French (1993) three-factor and Fama–French (2015) five-factor model in a time series setup to test the risk return relationship and finally results will be compared to newly proposed model to justify its robustness than the former two models. The nobleness of the present study lies in several ways first altogether a new robust five-factor asset pricing model developed with human asset investment which found to be superior than existing valuation models; second, in Indian context human asset investment factor is almost untouched by previous studies except Maiti (2019a, b, c), Maiti and Balakrishnan (2018, 2020) and few others.",6

China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” has gained enormous attention. The USA has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement and TPP11, which is now called Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and has been signed on 8 March 2018 in Chile. The Regional Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP)Footnote 1 has also gained momentum recently. The trilateral free trade agreement (FTA) between China, Japan, and South Korea, the USA and the EU free trade agreement (FTA) (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership—TTIP),Footnote 2 and other regional trade agreements have been emerging due to the deadlock of the WTO’s Doha Round. Against this backdrop, a new regional bloc called ‘Indo-Pacific’ has gained high prominence. Originally, this regional cooperation was aimed to foster a quadrilateral alliance (also known as Quad) between the United States, Japan, Australia, and India. However, several South, Southeast, East Asian and Pacific Island economies including Vietnam, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and some of the Indian Ocean Rim (IOR) countries have shown interests in joining the Indo-Pacific group. The attributes of the Indo-Pacific are quite appealing. The region comprises at least 38 countries that share 44% of world surface area and 65% of world population, and account for 62% of world-GDP and 46% of the world’s merchandise trade (Table 1). However, the region faces complex challenges in terms of economy, security and the environment.Footnote 3 Most of the Indo-Pacific studies however talk about maritime strategic and geopolitical aspects of the region. David (2012), for example, explores the political and maritime strategic discourse of the Indo-Pacific concept and tries to explore the maritime challenges that are being faced by India in the Indian Ocean and by the USA in the Pacific Ocean. He also discusses the different strategic pathways to meet the challenges. USAID (2015) attempts to inspect the trade relationship link of India with the Southeast and East Asian countries in the context of the Indo-Pacific. Mohan (2017) discusses the relevance of the Indo-Pacific alliance briefly, whilst Singh (2017) attempts to explore the maritime security under the Indo-Pacific context. De (2018), on the other, identifies scope for deepening Indo-Pacific cooperation in connectivity. Scott (2019) evaluates Indonesia’s grappling with the Indo-Pacific and concludes that whilst Indonesia certainly is on the rise as an Indo-Pacific actor, its continuing naval weakness undermines Indonesia’s “maritime nexus” stance suggesting a closer synergy for Indonesia with the US and Japanese Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative is suggested. Although most of the literature has argued that the Indo-Pacific cooperation is simply an emerging idea, which is yet to take a formal shape of regional cooperation bloc. The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)-based welfare analysis is one of the growing areas for economic analysis of different regional integration including TPP, TTIP, RCEP, and many other free trade agreements. Within the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)-based studies, most assume fixed factor supplies and variable factor prices. Gilbert et al. (2018) provide a detailed synthesis of CGE literature and discuss the economic impact of TPP. Kawasaki (2017) and Whittaker et al. (2013) allow for capital accumulation effects. Several papers modify the underlying theory of GTAP. USITC (2016) introduces an elastic labour supply, whilst Akgul et al. (2015) present firm heterogeneity in an exciting proof of concept. Rahman and Ara (2015), Strutt et al. (2015) and Petri and Plummer (2016) attempt to quantify the impact of TPP, TTIP and RCEP on different regions. Cheong and Tongzon (2013) analyse the economic effects of TTP and RCEP and argue that the TPP should be extended for its economic benefit to all Asian countries, including the China. Rollo et al. (2014) evaluate some of the potential effects of TTIP economic integration on low-income countries. Berden et al. (2009) calculate the effects of tariff and NTMs reduction of the proposed TTIP and find that EU GDP may be 0.7% higher whilst the USA GDP could increase by 0.3% per year starting 2018 compared to the baseline scenario. Ciuriak et al. (2016) use a modified version of the GTAP model with recursive dynamics model. The approach is similar to that of the GTAP-Dyn model described in Ianchovichina and McDougall (2001) and utilised in several studies (Cheong and Tongzon 2013; Lee and Itakura 2013). In other innovations, Li and Whalley (2014) employ an Armington-type model. Roh and Oh (2016) also introduce firm heterogeneity. Strutt et al. (2015) estimate the potential economic of TPP on New Zealand economy using GTAP-Dyn and find that the welfare gains to New Zealand ranging from US$ 371 million (tariffs only) to US$ 1.8 billion (tariffs plus NTMs). The above brief review shows that various aspects of TPP, CPTPP, TTIP, and RCEP have been analysed using CGE. However, there is no single research to quantify the impact on Indo-Pacific regional economic cooperation. It would, therefore, be interesting to see the implications of the Indo-Pacific trade deal. With the above background, the objective of this paper is to make a comparative analysis of likely impact of tariff reduction and trade facilitation under the Indo-Pacific regional integration on various macro- and trade variables. The main aim of the study is to explore different free trade agreements under the canopy of the Indo-Pacific framework. We simulate reductions of tariff and improved trade facilitation in CGE models. This study has the potential to provide profound insights into the currently active policy debate on the regional mega deal. Rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Followed by Introduction in Sect. 1, methodology is briefed in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the results and conclusions are drawn in Sect. 4.",4

The arguments over the structure and causes of inequality abound not only in the economic mainstream, but also in policy discussions. This discourse has been motivated by the growth of inequality not only in the developed and industrialized world, but also in countries enjoying a developing economy and the potential consequences remain to be a common concern. While there is a growing consensus that inequality results in severe social stratification and can upset economic demand in the long term, it thus turns into a question of how to appropriately address it by teasing out the underlying structural causes (Fakir et al. 2017). The roots of inequality can be traced back to the internal contradictions of the capitalistic society in the sense that the market mechanism itself leads to inequality. This is the view held by Marx and Ricardo, who formulated various laws that take account of the internal processes of the capitalistic system and how they propel inequality (Ricardo 1817; Marx 1867). Inequality can be viewed as a product of the changes in the democratic structures, laws, taxes, and institutions. This “institutional” approach intends to account for the emergence of inequality by studying the various institutional structures (Acemoglu and Robinson 2015). In this context, the economic and political institutions are produced by the endogenous distribution of political power, causing different income distributions. This explains the failure of political and economic institutions to control rent-seeking behavior that results in growing inequality. As a result, inequality derived from the poor institutional quality can be mainly considered as the failure of institutions to operate appropriately. Conversely, Piketty’s second fundamental law is tantamount to Marx and Ricardo’s notion of inequality as an inherent characteristic of a capitalistic economy. Among the various institutional quality indicators, economic freedom is a more important index for institutional quality. In the present study, we used economic freedom as an indicator of institutional quality in relation to cross-country income inequality, like Gwartney et al. (2004). The economic freedom index reflects the key elements of the institutional quality (Gwartney and Lawson 2003). In addition to growth, economic freedom is also a function of inequality across different nations. Investigating the possible influences of economic freedom on income inequality has been profusely undertaken by numerous researchers; however, the empirical evidence to support the findings remains to be at best variation. On the one side, higher economic freedom might be traced back to lower taxes and welfare expenditures, which are likely to have negative consequences to the low-income, on the other side, higher degrees of economic freedom may drive growth and lift the legal impediments that favor politically privileged groups and create economic opportunities to less privileged groups and lower income individuals (Perez-Moreno and Angulo-Guerrero 2016). De Soto (2000) contends that capital is the engine of labor productivity, and creates the wealth in developed countries. We contend in the present article that one of the primary determinants of inequality in any society is the level of economic freedom it offers. We postulate that through compromising the basic mechanisms of redistributive policy, economic freedom provides an environment in which inequality is likely to emerge; however, given the degree of economic freedom, this outcome can be changed (Bennett and Nikolaev 2017). Accordingly, we regard the latest progress in the field of inequality by exploring Piketty’s Hypothesis. This is of special interest to us as the second fundamental law proposes that inequality is a common feature of capitalism. If the second fundamental law holds, it implies that the effective functioning of capitalism is what drives inequality, along with distortive means such as institutional failure and economic freedom. In such a case, it is worth studying if the distortions induced by economic freedom are more involved than the returns to capital caused by functioning markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the theoretical links of economic freedom and Piketty’s Hypothesis to inequality. Section 3 discusses estimation method and data. Section 4 undertakes econometric specification and empirical estimates. Section 5 discusses the estimation results and Sect. 6 concludes with some policy implications.",4
9.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,05 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-020-00220-6,"Dynamic linkages between poverty, inequality, crime, and social expenditures in a panel of 16 countries: two-step GMM estimates",December 2020,Muhammad Khalid Anser,Zahid Yousaf,Khalid Zaman,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The study evaluated different United Nation sustainable development goals (SDGs), i.e., goals 1 and 2 (poverty reduction and hunger), goals 3 and 4 (promotion of health and education), goal 10 (reduced inequalities), and goal 16 (reduction of violence, peace and justice) to access pro-poor growth and crime reduction in a panel of 16 heterogeneous countries. The discussion of crime rate in pro-poor growth (PPG) agenda remains absent in the economic development literature, though Bourguignon (2000) stressed to reduce crime and violence by judicious income distribution; however, a very limited literature is available to emphasize the need of social safety nets for vulnerable peoples that should be included in the pro-growth policy agenda for broad-based economic growth. Kelly (2000) investigated the relationship between income inequality (INC_INEQ) and urban crime, and found that INC_INEQ is the strong predictor to influence violent crime rather than property crime, while poverty (POV) and economic growth (EG) significantly affect on property crime rather than violent crime. The policies should be developed for equitable income and sound EG for reducing POV and crime across the globe. Drèze and Khera (2000) examined the inter-district variations of intentional homicides rate (IHR) in India for the period of 1981 and found that there is no significant relationship between urbanization/poverty and murder rates, while literacy rate has a strong impact to reduce criminal violence in India. The results further indicate the lower murder rate in those districts where female to male ratio is comparatively high. The study emphasized the need to reduce crime, violence and homicides by significant growth policies for sustained EG in India. Neumayer (2003) investigated the long-run relationship between political governance, economic policies and IHR using the panel of 117 selected countries for the period of 1980–1997 and concluded that IHR can be reduce by good economic and political policies. The results specified that higher income level, good civic sense, sound EG, and higher level of democracy all are connected with the lower homicides rate in a panel of countries. The study emphasized the need to improve governance indicators in order to lowering the IHR across the globe. Jacobs and Richardson (2008) examined the interrelationship between INC_INEQ and IHR in a panel of 14 developed democracies nation and found that intentional homicides is the mounting concerns in those nations where the inequitable income distribution exists, while results further provoke the presence of young males associated with the higher murder rates in a region. The policies should be formulated caution with care while devising for judicious income distribution with demographic variables in the pro-growth agenda. Sachsida et al. (2010) found inertial effect on criminality and confirmed the positive relationship between INC_INEQ, urbanization and IHR. The study emphasized the importance of public security spending to reduce IHR in Brazil. Pridemore (2011) re-assessed the relationship between POV, INC_INEQ and IHR in a cross-national panel of US states and found POV-homicides’ linkages rather than inequality-homicides’ association. The study argued that there is substantially desire to re-assess the inequality-homicides’ linkages as it might be the misspecification of the model. Ulriksen (2012) examined the relationship between PPG, POV reduction and social security policies in the context of Botswana and found that broad-based social security policies have a significant impact to reduce POV, thus there is a strong need to include social security protections in the pro-poor growth (PPG) agenda for lowering the POV rates across the globe. Ouimet (2012) investigated the impact of socio-economic factors on IHR in a panel of 165 countries for the period 2010 and found that GIP triangle are strongly connected with the IHR for all countries, while for sub-samples, the results only support the inequality-homicides association rather than POV and EG induced IHR. The results highlighted the importance of GIP triangle to reduce IHR in a panel of selected countries. Liu et al. (2013) investigated the relationship between national scale indicators of socio-economic and demographic factors and crime rates in 32 Mexican states and found that EG, wages and unemployment negatively affect crime rates, while increase federal police force that is helpful to reduce crime rates; however, on the other way around, higher public security expenditures are linked with the higher crime rates in Mexican states. Chu and Tusalem (2013) investigated the role of state to reduce IHR in a panel of 183 nations and found that political instability increases IHR, while anocracies is the strong predictor to influence IHR in a panel of countries. The study concluded that IHR increases in those countries where there is high level of political instability and death penalty, while the amalgamation of democratic and autocratic features lead to increased IHR. The policies should be drawn to strengthen political governance across the globe. Adeleye (2014) evaluated the different determinants of INC_INEQ in a large panel of 137 countries using the time series data from 2000 to 2012 and found that per capita income (PCI), secondary education, rule of law index and unemployment rate are the strong predictors for INC_INEQ and IHR, while INC_INEQ considerably affected IHR rate in a region. Dalberis (2015) investigated the relationship between INC_INEQ, POV and crime rates in Latin American countries and found that INC_INEQ has no significant association with the crime rate in Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay and Salvador, while poverty is the strong predictor to influence crime in Brazil, Uruguay and Salvador. The results highlighted the need for pro-poorness of growth reforms that would be helpful to lowering the crime rates in Latin American countries. Harris and Vermaak (2015) considered the relationship between expenditures’ inequality and IHRe across 52 districts of South Africa and found that while keeping other district features constant, inequality does appear as a strong dominant player to induce IHR. The rational income distribution along with broad-based EG may play a vital role to reduce IHR in South Africa. Stamatel (2016) investigated the relationship between democratic cultural values and IHR in a panel of 33 democratic countries for the period 2010 and found that democratic cultural values have a positive and negative impact of IHR in the presence of strong democratic institutions and practices. Ahmed et al. (2016) identified the different predictors of economic and natural resources in the context of Iran using the time series data from 1965–2011 and found that labor productivity, exports, capital stock and natural resources are the main predictors of EG, which altogether are important for sustained long-term growth of the country. Enamorado et al. (2016) interlinked crime rates with higher INC_INEQ using a 20-year dataset of more than 2000 Mexican municipalities and confirmed the causal relationships between the two stated factors. The results confined that drug-related crime rates largely increase up to 36% if there is one-point increment in the INC_INEQ during the specified time period. The study concludes with the fact that drug-related violent crime rates are more severe due to high proliferation of large dispersion in the labor market in terms of negative job opportunities in illegal sector. Thus, the sound policies are imperative to seize drug trafficking organizations by force for pro-equality growth. Ling et al. (2017) analyzed the role of trade openness in Malaysian life expectancy using the data from 1960 to 2014. The results show that continued EG and trade openness substantially increase life expectancy during the study time period. Further, the results established the feedback relationship between income and life expectancy in a country. The study concludes that life expectancy may increase through imported healthcare goods, which improves the quality of life of the people, thus trade liberalization policies are imperative for healthy and wealthy wellbeing. Zaman (2018) extensively surveyed the large weighted sample of intellectuals about crime–poverty nexus and explored the number of socio-economic factors that concerned with high crime rate and POV incidence in Pakistan, including INC_INEQ, injustice, unemployment, low spending on education and health, price hikes, etc. There is a high need to increase social spending on education and health infrastructure in order to combat POV and crime rates in a given country. Imran et al. (2018) considered a time series data of US for a period of 1965–2016 and concluded that incidence of POV increases the intensity of property crime in a given country, while other controlling factors including country’s PCI and unemployment rate are not significantly associated with property crime in a country. The study concludes that property crime should be restricted by strong legislative and regulatory measures, judicious income distribution, and increasing minimum wage rate, which altogether would be helpful for the poor to reap economic benefits from PPG reforms in a country. Zaman et al. (2019) evaluated the role of education in crime reduction in a panel of 21 countries for a period of 1990–2015 and found a parabola relationship between PCI and crime rates in the presence of quality education and equitable justice across countries. The study further confirmed few other causal conceptions among the variables for making sound policy implications in the context of criminal justice. Piatkowska (2020) examined the social cost of POV in terms of increasing suicides rates, crime rates, and total violent rates in the United States and across 15 European nations during the period of 1993–2000. The results show that suicides–crime–violent rates are substantially increasing due to increase in relative POV and infant mortality rates across countries. The study argued that relative POV is the strong predictor to increase social cost of nation that needs efficient economic policies to reduce crime rates. Mukherjee (2019) discussed the role of social sustainability in achieving economic sustainability by reducing different forms of violent/crime rates through state intervention in the context of Indian economy by utilizing the data for a period of 2005–2016. The results further highlighted the need of socio-economic infrastructure development that would be helpful to provide safety nets to the poor in order to reduce crime rates in a country. Duque and McKnight (2019) presented the channel through which crime rates and legal system provide a pathway to increase INC_INEQ and POV across countries. The study further discussed and highlighted the socio-economic vulnerability that escalates through unequal distribution of income and high POV incidence, which need effective legal system to reduce crime rates. Khan et al. (2019a) surveyed the Bolivian economy to assess pro-poor environmental reforms that could improve the quality of life of the poor through judicious income distribution and sustainable environmental reforms. The results conclude that services’ sector and healthcare infrastructure would be helpful to reduce POV rate and achieve PPG process at country wide. Zaman et al. (2020) surveyed the large panel of countries (i.e., 124 countries) for a period of 2010–2013 to analyze the role of INC_INEQ and EG on POV incidence across countries. The results generally favor the strong linkages among the three stated factors to support GIP triangle, which forms PPG process. The study emphasized the need to adopt some re-corrective measures in order to provide social safety nets and income distribution in order to make a growth process more pro-poor. Kousar et al. (2019) confined its finding in favor of POV reduction through managing international remittances’ receipts and financial development that would be helpful to improve the mechanism of income distribution in a country like Pakistan. The study concluded that international remittances may play a vital role to reduce POV via the mediation of financial development in a country. The real problem is how to make EG more equitable, which is helpful to reduce POV and crime rates, and make a growth more pro-poor. The SDGs largely provoked the need to sustained economic activities, which helpful to make growth policies more poor friendly. The previous studies are widely discussed crime rates and POV reduction (see Zaman 2018; Khan et al. 2015; Heinemann and Verner 2006; etc.); however, a very few studies interlinked POV–crime nexus under PPG and Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis (see Saasa 2018; Berens and Gelepithis 2018, etc.). Based on the interconnections between crime, POV, and PPG, the study formulated the following research questions, i.e., Does crime rate negatively influenced GIP triangle, which sabotages the process of PPG? The recent study of Khan et al. (2019b) provoked the need of PPG policies to ensure sustainability agenda by including socio-economic and environmental factors in policy formulation, which gives favor to the poor as compared to the non-poor. In the similar lines, the social spending on education and healthcare infrastructure, and reforms needed to reduce labor market uncertainty in the form of lessen unemployment rate is considered the viable option for crime and POV reduction across countries (Khan et al. 2017). Thus, the study evaluated the question, i.e., To what extent social spending on education, health, and labor market are helpful to reduce crime rate, poverty, and income inequality across countries? This question would be equally benefited to the developmental economists and policy makers to devise a healthy and wealthy policy by increasing spending on social infrastructure for pro-equality growth (Wang 2017). The last question is based upon non-linear formulation of crime–POV nexus where it is evaluated as a second-order coefficient to check the parabola relationship between them, i.e., Does crime and poverty exhibit a parabola relationship between them? The question is all about the second-order condition, which confirmed one out of three conditions, i.e., either it is accepted an inverted U-shaped or U-shaped or flat relationship between them. The second-order condition assessed the probability to reduce crime rates and incidence of POV in policy formulation. In the light of SDGs, the study explored the impact of GIP triangle and crime rates on pro-growth and PPG policies, which is imperative for sustainable development across countries. The study added social expenditures in PPG dynamics to promote healthy and wealthy economic activities, which improves quality of life of the poor and helpful to reduce crime incidence across countries. The study is first in nature, as authors’ knowledge, which included GIP triangle and crime rate in PPG framework, while controlling different socio-economic factors, including education and health expenditures, unemployment rate, and trade openness. Further, an empirical contribution of the study is to include second-order coefficient of PCI for evaluating crime- and inequality-induced KC, while the study proceed to analyze forecast relationship between the crime and POV incidence over a next 10-year time period.

It has been a main question for many decades for which no clear answer has been proposed to achieve a strong consensus on (Dufrenot et al. 2010; Falvey et al. 2012; Greenaway and Morgan 1998; Greenawa et al. 1998; Grossman and Krueger 1991; Prebisch 1950; Singer 1950; Singer and Gray 1988; Talberth and Bohara 2006; Ulasan 2015; Zahonogo 2017). This can be due to the various relationships of openness with each element of sustainability (i.e., environmental quality and economic growth). Although there are a wide range of hypotheses and theories on the relationship, there is no strong consensus on the nexus of openness either with the environmental pollution or with the economic growth (Arezk et al. 2014; Grossman and Krueger 1991; Moutinho et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2017; Talberth and Bohara 2006; Zhang, et al. 2017). Openness has four potential relationships with economic growth, as a pillar of sustainability, including neutral, positive, negative, and non-linear relationships. The last three hypotheses are presented in Fig. 1. Based on the figure, the growth hypothesis claims a positive nexus between openness and sustainability due to the increase in specification, knowledge spillover, and return to scale, resulted from the openness (Alesina et al. 2000; Almeida and Fernandes 2008; Baldwin et al. 2005; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1997; Bond et al. 2005; Zahonog 2017). However, the depression hypothesis suggests a negative connection which might be owing to incapability in society and vitality in domestic industries (Clemens and Williamson 2001; Fagerberg 1994; Irwin 2002; Musila and Yiheyis 2015; O’Rourke 2000). In addition to the couple of linear hypotheses, many suggest non-linear relations including J-carve pattern, Laffer curve of trade, pollution haven hypothesis, and Prebisch–Singer theory (Arezki et al. 2014; Colagiuri and Morrice 2015; Costa and Santos 2013; Greenaway and Morgan 1998; Greenaway et al. 1998, 2002; Harvey et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). Finally, the four hypotheses believe no nexus between openness and economic growth as a sustainability pillar (Sachs and Warner 1995; Ulasan 2015). Environmental quality, as another pillar of sustainability, has the three potential relationships with openness, as mentioned above (Grossman and Krueger 1991). These wide range of theories and hypotheses not only do not assist in the identification of the nexus between openness and sustainability, but also they make it more dubious. Potential nexuses of openness and sustainability This ambiguity is a problem statement for the oil-exporting countries, emerging with more focus on the issue in the future studies, as ours deals with it. The oil-exporting countries, on the one hand, are growing their economy via exporting the oil, thanks to the technological and transportational advances which lead to a considerably greater openness. The openness, on the other hand, is a channel to import the more expensive and consumptive commodities into the oil-exporting. Not only does it waste the oil income, rather than the development of infrastructure, but also it might damage the domestic industry, or rather the economic growth (Arezki et al. 2014; Harvey et al. 2010; Prebisch 1950; Singer 1950). In addition to the effects of openness on economic growth as a sustainability pillar, the production and exportation of oil are polluting the environment which is another pillar of the sustainability. This contradiction is proposing some questions which we investigate in the study, as mentioned below. The main objective of the study is to estimate the relationship between openness and sustainability in the oil-exporting countries. It is achievable with answering three questions: the first one is, what is the nexus between openness and brown economic growth (including merely the economic perspective) in the oil-exporting countries; the second one is, what is the nexus between openness and green economic growth (growth including economic, social and, environmental considerations) in the oil-exporting countries; and third one is, how wide is the gap between growth and sustainability. Answering these questions provide vital clues to the strategical question of whether the oil-exporting countries have been successful in compensating the depreciation in their natural capital by the well worthwhile investment. In case of a positive response, their policy-makers should pursue their current strategies; otherwise, they are advised to restructure the economic, social, and environmental policies to make them consistent with the sustainability framework. The novelty of the study is to employ both the green economic growth and brown economic growth simultaneously for the measurement of the relationship between openness and sustainability, which has three key pillars including economic, social, and environmental one. Based on Fig. 2, the GDP focuses solely on the economy pillar of sustainability, ignorance of the environmental issues, namely brown GDP while the green GDP (environmentally adjusted GDP) embraces not only the economic items, but also the social and environmental ones (Talberth and Bohara 2006; Wang et al. 2011). In this study, we take the advantage of both brown GDP and green GDP while no previous study has such a simultaneity, despite numerous previous researches. Brown GDP versus green GDP",9

A panel data analysis,December 2020,Md Abdullah Omar,Kazuo Inaba,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Financial inclusion connotes all initiatives that make formal financial services accessible and affordable, primarily to low-income people. In recent years, financial inclusion has been perceived as a dynamic tool for attaining multidimensional macroeconomic stability, sustainable and inclusive economic growth, employment generation, poverty reduction, and income equality for advanced and developing countriesFootnote 1 alike. Moreover, financial inclusion seems an incremental and complementary approach to meeting the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (Chibba 2009). The emergence of financial inclusion promotes social inclusion through convenient access, availability, and usage of rules-based formal financial services by the “newly banked”. These are generally underprivileged population segments, vulnerable groups such as rural dwellers, women, and low-income families who benefit enormously from basic financial services like savings, borrowings, payment, and insurance (World Bank 2014). Due to insufficient income levels and market discrimination in developing regions, there are still millions of people involuntarily excluded from the financial system, which creates potential loss of savings, investable funds, and accumulation of wealth. Financial inclusion helps to fill these gaps and provide households and firms greater access to resources needed for finance consumption and investment and thereby raise the level of economic activity. In addition, financial inclusion makes growth inclusive: access to finance can enable economic agents to take part in long-term participatory investment activities, facilitate efficient allocation of productive resources and thus reduce the cost of capital, cope with unexpected short-term shocks, significantly improve day-to-day management of finances, and reduce usually exploitative informal sources of credit (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2015, 2018). Despite decades of rapid progress in reducing poverty and boosting prosperity, a large portion of the world’s poorer population still struggles to attain a minimum standard of living across developing regions, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Progress in reducing extreme poverty seems uneven in these regions because of geographical and country-specific factors. The World Bank (2016) reports that more than half of the world’s extreme poor (50.7%) live in sub-Saharan Africa. Asia contains 42.7% of the world’s poor, though the whole region has a strong historical performance in reducing overall poverty by virtue of massive growth in emerging large economies. Latin America and the Caribbean contain the next-highest portion of the world’s poor (4.4%). Poverty reduction in developing regions is slowing because of the prevailing nature of extreme income inequality, which is considered a powerful threat to economic progress. To this end, the World Bank set goals to end extreme poverty by 2030 and raise the shared prosperity of the bottom 40% of people in each country through reducing income inequality. Therefore, financial inclusion has moved up the global reform agenda and gained great interest for its potential to break the vicious cycle of poverty and lower income inequality. Real-world financial systems are far from inclusive, so more emphasis is being placed on financial inclusion, which reflects its potentially transformative power to accelerate inclusive development. Given its multifaceted implications, financial inclusion represents a core topic for the World Bank (2014). The United Nations member countries have included financial inclusion as a formal target and a key objective in their development agenda (Sahay et al. 2015). Despite progress in this direction, evidence on the macroeconomic effects of financial inclusion is limited due to inconsistent macro-level data across countries. Many studies have investigated the determinants of financial inclusion, appropriate measures of financial inclusion at the individual and country level, and effective types of financial services on the user level. There is also evidence on financial inclusion’s effects on economic growth, financial stability, female empowerment, poverty alleviation, and income inequality, which has laid the foundation for this field of research. However, these studies are not enough to understand the broader macroeconomic implications of financial inclusion. This study seeks to take another step in the existing literature by examining the relationship between financial inclusion, poverty, and income inequality, sampling entire developing countries, focusing on Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean region, whose level of voluntary as well as involuntary financial exclusion is relatively higher than that of other countries. Thus, this study addresses the following questions: first, what are the crucial factors that affect the level of financial inclusion in developing countries? Second, does financial inclusion reduce poverty and income inequality in developing countries? Third, are there any conditions under which financial inclusion can play a more effective role in reducing poverty and income inequality in developing countries? This study contributes to the following existent financial inclusion related literature. First, it constructs a novel index of financial inclusion using a broad set of financial sector outreach indicators with an extensive panel data set of 2004–2016, following Sarma’s multidimensional approach (2012). Second, it identifies the determinants of financial inclusion and analyzes the impact of financial inclusion on reducing poverty and income inequality, focusing on entire developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean region. Third, it assesses conditional relationships between financial inclusion and other micro- or macroeconomic factors under which financial inclusion mitigates poverty and income inequality in developing countries. To our knowledge, there are no empirical studies that broadly examine the indirect provisions through which financial inclusion reduces poverty and income inequality. Fourth, it analyzes all major relationships between variables using a panel data set and fixed effect model to properly process endogeneity associated with financial inclusion. This study finds that per capita real GDP and ratio of internet users positively influence the level of financial inclusion in developing countries, while age dependency ratio, inflation, and income inequality have a detrimental effect. Our results show robust evidence that economies with higher financial inclusion significantly reduce poverty rates and income inequality in developing countries. Moreover, the interaction terms of financial inclusion with GDP growth and secondary school enrollment ratio are statistically significant for poverty, whereas the interaction terms of financial inclusion with GDP growth and rule of law are statistically significant for income inequality. This suggests that the effectiveness of financial inclusion depends not only on itself, but also on other conditions in reducing poverty and income inequality. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews existing literature related to the topic. Chapter 3 reveals the empirical methodology, data measurement, and construction of the composite financial inclusion index for testing impacts through regression analysis. Chapter 4 presents the empirical results and discussions, and Chapter 5 concludes with a summary of our findings and policy implications.",132

According to Prajogo (2016), product innovations are effective in the changing environment but are ineffective in the competitive market. Rather, process innovations show superiority in a fiercely competitive industry. Another perspective of innovation research emphasizes technological innovation as one of the most inimitable innovations (Xin et al. 2010). Indeed, many product innovations, including new products and new features of products (such as designs or promotions), are targets of imitations (Bigliardi and Galati 2013), while the majority of process innovations are hardly imitated due to secrecy of the manufacturing processes or its dependence on social network-based supply chains. In particular, in a competitive and matured market, innovative firms encounter many copycats. As mentioned below, past literature except a few reports has not investigated the economic impact of incremental product innovations (IPIs) in the food-manufacturing industry or even its potential. As a fiercely competitive industry, imitations may hinder effective analysis. This study attempts to overcome this limitation by focusing on three different intellectual properties rights (IPRs) as proxies of different types of hard-to-imitate innovations. Prior scholarly works validated these proxies by examining their correlations with various firm performance indicators. Following these works, this study tests the impact of different types of innovation on firm financial performance. Innovation trends in the food-manufacturing industry, one of the most competitive and matured businesses, clearly recollect this theoretical question. Previous studies have noted that firms in the food-manufacturing industry do not substantially facilitate product and technological innovation activities, compared with other manufacturing industries (Beckeman and Skjöldebrand 2007; Christensen et al. 1996; Hullova et al. 2019). This is evidenced by the low ratio of research and development (R&D) intensity to sales (Beckeman and Skjöldebrand 2007; Garcia Martinez and Briz 2000; Trott and Simms 2017) and by small amount of patent applications (Christensen et al. 1996; Dernis et al. 2015; Garcia Martinez and Briz 2000). Rather, this industry has been process innovation-oriented (Archibugi et al. 1991; Batterink et al. 2006; Triguero et al. 2013). Reality indicates that product innovations are endogenously inferior to process innovations in the food manufacturing industry. Still, we need further validation for judging the values of product innovations in this industry. Product innovations contain multiple aspects other than new product development. In particular, this study focuses IPI, which implements small changes in a product’s characteristics, design, quality, functions, or components to satisfy the needs of the consumers (Bhaskaran 2006). In fact, some empirical studies have referred to such innovation as a marketing innovation and revealed the positive effects of narrowly defined product innovations and innovation performance of firms (Gunday et al. 2011). However, without any exclusivity, IPIs will soon lose competitiveness. Therefore, firms have tried to protect their products by registering IPRs preventing counterfeits (Japan Patent Office, 2011, 2017). For example, as Silayoi and Speece (2007) note, packaging affects consumers’ product selection and willingness to pay; once a package with a new design is recognized by consumers, it is expected that continuously utilizing it will gradually lead to sales and profits. Naturally, firms will thus continue to protect the design patent, expecting the long-term preservation of design patents reflects building the brand and preventing competitor’s imitation. On the other hand, if the number of IPRs is too high, it will be difficult to maintain consistency with the product development strategy inside the firm. Fleming and Sorenson (2001) proved using patent data that as the number of element technologies increases, the possibility of interaction between technologies and products will increase, and as a result, it becomes difficult to combine them. This is reflected as a firm’s marginal costs. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of IP management, the maintenance of IPRs and monitoring for counterfeit goods in the market are the primary tasks. In other words, the better the design or technology, the higher the need for posterior costs. These arguments show that while IPI activities make a positive contribution to firm performance, there is a limit due to the increasing organizational and managerial costs. Most of IPRs such as patent and design patent can be retained for 20 years after registration, and it should be examined how much this retention increases the difficulty of imitating the target product and contributes to sales and profits. This study revisits the value of product innovations in the food-manufacturing industry by differentiating new product development and IPIs and by focusing on innovations protected by IPRs. In specific, we examined how new product development and IPI affect the firm performance (i.e., sales and profits). As mentioned in the next section, IPRs have been used as a representative proxy of product and process innovation activities in numerous studies. But only a few studies have evaluated the impact of IPRs on firm performance in the food industry. In this study, we adopted a new approach in which patents, design patents, and trademarks are included as proxy variables for each innovation activity, while using the method used in innovation studies for other industries. This methodological setting realizes the control of endogeneity between the probability of imitations of certain types of innovations and the returns from them. In doing so, there are two academic contributions of this study. First, it quantitatively indicates the extent to which the effect of IPI, which has been difficult to quantitatively verify to date, contributes to the improvement in firm performance. Second, it proposes a new quantitative method to demonstrate firm performance based on IPRs, which has been challenging to analyze for the reasons noted above. In the next section, we describe the relation between strategic choice of innovations and their economic returns and between IPRs and types of innovations. In Sect. 3, we state the methodology of our empirical analyses and show their results in Sect. 4. In the subsequent section, we discuss interpretations of our econometrical achievements and logical deductions. Finally, managerial implications and limitations are provided.",6

Rueda-Cantuche,Tamas Revesz,Bert Saveyn,Male,Male,Male,Male,"During the last 25 years, an increasing number of academic articles and policy reports applying input–output analysis and multisectoral modelling have used the GTAP databases. GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) is a global network of researchers and policy-makers conducting quantitative analysis of international policy issues. GTAP’s goal is to improve the quality of quantitative analysis of global economic issues within an economy-wide framework (https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/).Footnote 1 Recent applicationsFootnote 2 span areas ranging from carbon emission and climate change (Weber and Matthews 2007; Lenzen et al. 2010; Wiedmann et al. 2010; Saveyn et al. 2011; Peters et al. 2011; Arto et al. 2014; Steen-Olsen et al. 2014; Edens et al. 2015; Labat et al. 2015; Vandyck et al. 2016), energy (Wiebe et al. 2012; Peters and Hertel 2016), air quality (Vrontisi et al. 2016; OECD 2016, Kitous et al. 2017) and water footprints (Feng et al. 2011; Holland et al. 2015; Cazcarro et al. 2016); to agricultural economics and policy (Banse et al. 2008; Hertel et al. 2010), trade policies and free trade agreements (European Commission 2013, 2016; Pelkmans et al. 2014; Boyer and Schuschny 2010; Kutlina-Dimitrova 2015; USITC 2006, 2007), and the analysis of global value chains, productivity and international trade (Lejour et al. 2012; Roson and Sartori 2016; Owen et al. 2016; Steen-Olsen et al. 2016). Users of the GTAP database can be found in universities, academic institutions and intergovernmental organizationsFootnote 3 alike. Given the global reach of these publications and their policy relevance, as well as the differences found in the literature with respect to other similar input–output databases (Andrew and Peters 2013; Owen et al. 2014; Inomata and Owen 2014; Peters et al. 2011; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013; Jones et al. 2016), there is a pressing need for consistently matching the GTAP database with official national statistics from countries and making sure that the GTAP database has sufficient statistical quality to address such policy analyses. The GTAP database requires input–output tables at basic prices with a distinction between domestic and imported uses and input–output tables at producer prices, including separated matrices of taxes less subsidies on products (Huff et al. 2000). With such purpose, this paper develops the EU-GTAP conversion method, a new conversion method for the whole EU that guarantees that the EU data supplied to the GTAP database respect the new statistical standards (European System of Accounts—ESA10Footnote 4) and Eurostat (ESTAT) official statistics. The resulting input–output tables (IOTs) in GTAP for the EU (for each Member State, 28 sets of tables) include the most recent updated supply, use and input–output tables (SUIOTs) and methods from Eurostat, while they are in line with the GTAP requirements. Further, the work follows Eurostat’s recommendations for the estimation of missing IOTs (Rueda-Cantuche et al. 2017). Eurostat has been consulted throughout the different stages of the work. Even though this conversion method has been developed for the GTAP database, it can be easily extended and applied to other similar IO databases with different classifications schemes in relation to the original data sources. Figure 1 schematically shows the EU-GTAP conversion method that is further explained in detail with Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and a numerical example. Section 2 gives an overview of the GTAP requirement, the data sources and estimation methods for missing input data. Section 3 states the problem of conversion and describes the main challenges while Sect. 4 provides some insights about the possible causes of the differences found between the current and former estimates of the EU-GTAP IOTs. Section 5 concludes with some lessons learnt and recommendations for future updates. Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 are also provided online including: (1) a step-wise detailed description of the EU-GTAP conversion method with a numerical example in a separate file; (2) the correspondence list of the Eurostat and GTAP sectorial classifications, and (3) more detailed insights into some of the element-wise differences between the current and former versions of the EU-GTAP IOTs.

Over 90% of fishers in the world are employed in small-scale fishing operations particularly in developing countries (FAO 2012). Small-scale fisheries are often not well-managed and are under extensive pressure both on local and global scales (Berkes et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2010; Kittinger et al. 2013). Consequently, households around fisheries resources are faced with a high level of poverty, food insecurity and insufficient livelihood alternatives (Silva 2006; Béné et al. 2007; Wallner-Hahn et al. 2016). Additionally, the growing population around fisheries resources has influenced environmental stresses and overfishing due to the fishing pressure exerted in the nearshore fisheries (Pomeroy et al. 2016). Lake Victoria is the world’s second-largest freshwater and the largest tropical lake, with a total surface area of 68,800 km2 (Witte and van Densen 1995). The lake’s surface areas are shared by three countries which are Tanzania (51%), Uganda (43%) and Kenya (6%). It supports the largest inland fishery and livelihood of communities, but also accounts for about 1% of the world’s capture production (World Bank 2012). It recently has changed from a multi-species to single-specie fishery that is dominated by the introduced Nile perch (Lates niloticus) (Linnaeus, 1758) (Aloo et al. 2017). Nile perch, is a predatory fish of high commercial and recreational value supporting a multimillion-dollar export industry that offers the three East African countries an average of US $350 million in export earnings annually (Marshall and Mkumbo 2012; Njiru et al. 2014; Aloo et al. 2017). As a consequence, catch and effort continued to expand in Lake Victoria in the last decades causing overfishing of Nile perch despite the introduction of the fisheries management practices (Van der Knaap et al. 2002; Kolding et al. 2008; Obiero et al. 2015). Over-exploitation of fishery resources has become the main challenge not only to users of the resource, but also the society at large, which is likely to affect the livelihood of Nile perch fishers in the future (Tetteh 2010). This calls for an understanding of different livelihood strategies that can sustain the livelihood of Nile perch fishers at the same time conserving the fishery resources. The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF/SLA) has been widely used in the assessment of livelihoods of communities around natural resource. For instance, Ferrol-Schulte et al. (2013) focusing on sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA) as a framework for understanding and guiding policy-making in coastal and marine social-ecological systems. Other studies employed SLA to understand the impact of fishers mobility, climate change and poverty on fishers livelihood (Badjeck et al. 2010; Nunan 2010). Some of the methodologies that have been used to assess the livelihood strategies of artisanal fishers includes, ecosystem approach to fisheries, management for resilience, social-ecological systems and a meta-analysis methodology (FAO 2003; Garcia et al. 2003; Carpenter et al. 2001; Carpenter et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2004; Berkes et al. 2003; Evans et al. 2011; Pomeroy et al. 2016). These methods were specific to one particular aspect of analysis and failed to integrate different complex aspects of livelihood together. Also, there are insufficient studies conducted to assess various optimum alternatives for artisanal fishers livelihood using the multi-criteria cluster analysis such as analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) model. Unlike other models, the analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) model is an effective model that helps to deal with complex decision-making by reducing complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons, and then synthesizing the results. In addition, it helps to capture both subjective and objective aspects of a decision. Furthermore, the AHP includes a useful technique for checking the consistency of the decision-maker’s evaluations, thus reducing the bias in the decision-making process (Saaty 1990, 2010; Adamus and Florkowski 2016). Therefore, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature and provide optimal and priority strategies for enhancing Nile perch fishers’ livelihood in Lake Victoria Tanzania by using the multi-criteria cluster analysis approach, specifically analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) model.",2

For this reason, knowledge about why one country invests in another and what influences it is vital for governments and multinational enterprise (MNE) managers alike in order to ensure effective policy-making and to assess potential costs and benefits for firms (Aguiar et al. 2006). Currently, there is a controversial discussion about the decisive factors and polices that influence FDI in the global economy which is also due to the plethora of research about the determinants of FDI which does not find consensus (Du et al. 2012; Mellahi and Guermat 2001; Zait et al. 2014). Consequently, it is impossible to assess all possible determinants of FDI, and hence this dissertation will look at German FDI abroad and how location choices for this type of investment are influenced by cultural differences between home and host country. There are many forms of distance; i.e., geographical, political or economic, however, as Gomez-Mejia and Palich (1997) pointed out, cultural differences are an inevitable challenge for an internationally expanding firm and crucial to consider. Despite its alleged importance, the plethora of research to determine the reason for FDI abroad all too often seems to neglect the relevance of culture and, additionally, underestimates, ignores or not appreciates differences in sectorial characteristics especially in the service sector, but instead uses aggregated data for their analysis which significantly distorts the outcome (Sathe and Handley-Schachler 2006). The operational aspect of international business demands interaction across borders with people and their firms, which are inherently bound to their culture. The resulting differences in norms, values and beliefs promote misunderstanding and jeopardize business success and eventually can end an FDI endeavor in the red (Constanza 2001). Several scholars and blame the lack of what Johnson et al. (2006) mention in their study to be “cross-cultural competence” as a central factor for the failure of international firms. An understanding and appreciation of cultural differences is paramount to effectively predict responses of and corporate with suppliers, clients and sometimes even competitors which makes comprehending cultural implications of FDI an indispensable necessity especially in the service sector (Constanza 2001; Johnson et al. 2006). The impact of culture can also be observed by mentioning Kok and Ersoy (2009) who argue that foreign investors are influenced by the profitability of the project, the ease of subsidiary integration and the host country’s environment. Especially the latter two factors are believed to be strongly impeded or improved by culture which ultimately affects the first factor (Zait et al. 2014). Consequently, ignoring the cultural foundation of FDI can result in missed opportunities, restricted performance, a complete dissolution of a joint venture or a withdrawal from the market (Stephens and Greer 1995). Most of the literature generalized on the determinants of FDI. Nowadays, with the dominance of FDI in the service sector for many economies, this can be deemed not to be appropriate anymore. In the past, research has almost exclusively concentrated on FDI in manufacturing or on the aggregation of sectors and strikingly few papers have examined FDI in the service sector. Also for Raff and von der Ruhr (2001) and many others this is surprising given that global FDI stock and flows in the service sector have overtaken the manufacture FDI figure (Kolstad and Villanger 2008), which makes FDI determinants in the service sector crucial for effective policies and educated investment decisions. Countries, for instance, need to re-evaluate if their policies for attracting manufacturing FDI are as effective as for services. Already Dunning (1998) recognized the gained importance of FDI in the service sector. Clark and Rajaratnam (1999, p. 307) even argue that “the 21st century will be the century of services” amplifying the need for research in this area. With the continuous liberalization of FDI in the service sector, firms have more countries to enter, also countries which are more culturally distant. The “newness” of this type of FDI makes it crucial to investigate.",2

There are hot debates among policymakers and academicians on the pros and cons of the current cross-border financial integration. In principle, financial integration enables an economy to borrow from foreign sources for financing domestic investment and also to increase access to advance technology and management skills, thus promoting productivity growth. However, this integration can also be blamed for being an important transmitter through which economic vulnerability spreads across economies. It also causes macroeconomic instability even financial crises. Recent financial turmoil directs policymakers to rethink appropriate financial opening policies for growth. A vital issue in the debate of financial integration is whether openness to foreign capital has significant growth benefits and whether these benefits compensate for the risks. In theory, there are a number of channels through which financial openness should affect economic performance. In a standard neo-classical framework, opening international capital markets generates capital flows from capital-abundant toward capital-scarce countries, thereby promoting growth in the poor countries through acceleration in the convergence process. While the industrial countries are capital affluent, the developing countries are relatively capital scarce; this fact should generate higher growth in developing economies and welfare gains for both groups. Nevertheless, there are few pieces of robust empirical evidence regarding a causal link between financial openness and economic growth. The majority of the studies tends to find no effect or, at best, mixed results. Quinn (1997), Vanassche (2004), Quinn and Toyoda (2008), and Gygli et al. (1999) evidence robust positive association between Capital account liberalization and economic growth. Whereas Kraay (1998), Rodrik (1998), Klein (2005), O’Donnell (2001), Durham (2004), Woo (2009), Alfaro et al. (2009), Baltabaev (2014), Milesi-Ferretti (2018), etc. do not find direct or casual link between financial openness and economic growth. In recent study, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2018) show the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. It documents the evolution of international financial integration since the global financial crisis. Unlike a majority of the previous empirical studies, this paper attempts to change the direction of the financial openness and growth nexus debate by focusing on the consequence of financial openness on productivity growth rather than on economic growth. Several previous literatures on growth issues have shown that a large share of cross-country differences in economic performance is obsessed by total factor productivity (TFP) rather than factor accumulation (physical and human capital). Hall and Jones (1999) conclude that GDP variation is mostly explained by variations in TFP. Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) also illustrate that GDP growth differentials are primarily caused by the differences in the growth rates of TFP. Bonfiglioli (2008) states that if financial integration only promotes capital accumulation and accelerates convergence, then its positive effect is expected to be short-lived. If instead, it raises TFP, it is most likely to stimulate long-term growth. Similarly, Bekaert et al. (2011) show that the impact of openness on TFP growth is more important than the effect on capital growth. They also explains why the growth effects of liberalization appear to be largely permanent rather than temporary. The literature on financial integration makes use of two distinctive groups of measures: de facto and de jure indicators. In particular, de jure indicators refer to the legal status of the financial liberalization process (Chinn and Ito 2008). De facto indicators measure the actual openness of financial transactions, usually expressed by stock, or flow ratios of assets, liabilities, the sum of both, or their components (FDI, portfolio investments, etc.) in the percentage to GDP (Gehringer 2013b). Most of the studies like Quinn (1997), Rodrik (1998), Edison et al. (2002a), Arteta et al. (2003), Quinn and Toyoda (2008), Bonfiglioli (2008), Lee (2016), etc. that examine the effects of financial integration have relied on de jure measures of capital account openness that reflect legal restrictions on capital movements. However, to realize the collateral benefits, de facto integration measures are also important. Because of the lack of enforcement, de jure indices of financial globalization do not reflect the actual extent to which the capital flows evolve in response to legal restrictions. Many countries have capital controls that are quite strict on document but that are roughly ineffectual in practice. Therefore, their de facto levels of integration—measured by capital flows or stocks of foreign assets and liabilities—are quite high. To address both regal restriction and actual extent of capital movement, this paper considers both de jure and de facto measures of openness. A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between financial integration and productivity growth is conducted using a wide-range dataset that includes various measures (both de jure and de facto) of financial integration for a large number of developed and developing countries. In the baseline regression analysis, different capital control/openness indices (e.g., Di and Ka)Footnote 1 as de jure measures of integration and stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) relative to GDP as de-facto financial integration are considered. It is widely believed that FDI is the most stable form of capital inflows. Strong theoretical discussions and several pieces of empirical evidence suggest that FDI flows generate many of the indirect benefits of financial integration. This paper provides empirical evidence using dynamic panel regressions (system GMM and fixed effect) from a large sample of developed and developing countries observed over the period of 1970–2014. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that both de jure and de facto measures of financial integration matter for TFP growth after controlling for the usual determinants of growth. The findings are robust to alternative regression specifications and attempt to control for endogeneity. Theoretical and empirical literature (Borensztein et al. 1998; Edwards 2001; Arteta et al. 2003; Durham 2004; Woo 2009; Alfaro et al. 2009; Baltabaev 2014, etc.) recently suggested that the absorptive capacity of a host country plays important roles in realizing the benefits of financial integration. To investigate whether the financial development of domestic economies has roles in realizing the benefits of financial integration, this research uses interaction terms of financial integration measures and a financial sector development indicator (private credit to GDP). The empirical results show that economies with better-developed financial markets do not necessarily benefit more from FDI in accelerating their economic growth, which is contrary to Alfaro et al. (2009). They find that countries with well-developed financial markets gain significantly from FDI via TFP improvements. We use the dataset of capital control measures (2015) as de jure measure of capital control that is very new, and to the best of our knowledge, no published paper has used this dataset yet for the analysis of financial integration and TFP relationship. In addition to the basic analysis of international financial integration and TFP growth nexus, we focus more deeply on the role of financial development of the host economy in realizing the benefits of financial integration. The next section reviews theoretical arguments and empirical evidence of the financial integration effects on economic growth and productivity growth. Section 3 discusses the empirical framework and estimation issues. Sect. 4 explains data, measures of different variables, and their sources. Section 5 shows the empirical findings followed by discussions of results. This paper concludes with a brief summary of the findings and their implications in Sect. 6 “Conclusion”.",3

According to Solow–Swan, economic growth rate is higher in poor countries than rich ones, implying that it will be more convergent in the long run. This was the initial idea of convergence which was later extended to other domains including price and income distribution. Justice is defined in Islamic thought as administration and protection of rights against wrongs and oppression and is the golden mean between the extremes of excess and deficiency (Sajjadi 1983, p. 274–275). It is also defined as equality, fairness and impartiality, on the one hand, and balance, moderation, proportionality, and compliance with order, on the other. Justice is a religious and rational conception that provides the basis for evaluation of religions and is a virtue to be realized in an ideal state. Thus, it lies at the heart of religious doctrine by which communal acts are measured to comply with Islamic thought. Economic justice is a major sub-domain of justice that covers social justice as it explains interests, desires, state of existence and competition between individuals within a given society. Distributive justice is an important index of economic justice. It denotes a situation in which too much possession of something by someone leads to deprivation of another of the same thing. Distributive justice is best applied in allocating rare products, services, resources and goods that directly or indirectly cause conflicting demands. Therefore, it calls for fair distribution of material goods among all social members (Eivazlou 2010, p. 7–12). Establishing Islamic economic justice has always been the prime objective of Islamic governing system. A principal aspect of Islamic justice in economics is distribution of income, which means fair allocation of income to families within a society or between countries. Local distribution of income to realize justice and promote effectiveness is also important. Islamic countries host a major part of world population. An analysis of income distribution and its related transformations in these communities contributes to determining its status and promoting distributive justice. It is imperative to identify communities with unfair distribution in order to establish policies to achieve a more balanced distribution. In addition to having a fair income distribution system, it is expected that Islamic countries adopt a more long-term convergent approach towards distribution. In other words, communities that score low at growth rate of income distribution index should try in the long run to achieve mean growth rate. Gini coefficient is used for analyzing income distribution. Albu (2012) studied convergence of Gini coefficient in EU countries during 2000–2011 and found an accentuated convergence inside the EU-10 group, but a significant divergence inside EU-15. Similarly, Chambers and Dhongde (2016) studied convergence of Gini coefficient in some countries and reported positive results. Thus, considering the gap in the literature and lack of studies on Islamic countries, the present study examines convergence of income distribution as an index of economic justice in selected Islamic countries (Albania, Bangladesh, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Maldives, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, Tajikistan, Turkey, Yemen and Tunisia) during 1995–2015 using beta-type convergence and generalized method of moment. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the review of the literature. Section 3 deals with research methodology. Section 4 is the analysis of results. Finally, concluding remarks and suggestions are given in Sect. 5.",

Insight from Ghana’s cocoa industry,December 2020,Gideon Danso-Abbeam,Lloyd J. S. Baiyegunhi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"From the time cocoa cultivation was introduced as a farming business in 1897 in Ghana, the crop has been an essential source of livelihood for most of the rural folks in the southern part of the country. Not only has the crop been beneficial to smallholder farmers, but it also has a direct influence on Ghana’s macroeconomic balances through foreign exchange earnings and improvement in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For instance, about 790,000 smallholder farmers are engaged in cocoa production and contribute to about 32% of the total export revenue in 2013 (Ghana Statistical Services [GSS] 2014). In 2015, the cocoa sector contributed about US$631 million, representing about 1.9% of Ghana’s GDP (Ghana Statistical Service [GSS] 2016). Further, Ghana’s cocoa industry has also created many employment opportunities along its value chain through backward and forward linkages. Thus, the cocoa sector is key to the socio-economic development of the country. Despite the contribution of cocoa to rural livelihoods and macroeconomic balances, the sector is still faced with many challenges. One of the significant challenges is the over-reliance on natural land productivity and expansion in land under cultivation to increase yield (Besseah and Kim 2014). Thus, cocoa production is partly responsible for the destruction of the Ghanaian green forest. As farmlands are exhausted, and the soil loses its quality, there is a decline in agricultural output. Consequently, the industry dependence on the expansion of farmland to boost productivity is not sustainable. Moreover, the fluctuation in cocoa output over the years is an urgent call on the primary stakeholders to designed policies oriented toward sustainable industrial growth. For instance, Ghana achieved a targeted one million metric tonnes in 2010/11 cocoa production year. However, this level has been unsustainable as output has been fluctuating downwards afterwards. A low output growth relative to its potential, coupled with high prices of inputs such as agrochemicals relative to farmers’ real income is partly responsible for the fluctuating growth rate in the industry. For cocoa to continue to have its significant impact on the Ghanaian economy, resources available to farmers ought to be optimized. Casteneda et al. (2018) noted that about 80% of the extreme poor live in the rural areas of developing countries and their livelihoods are tied farm activities—either from their farms or agricultural wage employment. Thus, their per capita growth and general socioeconomic welfare are also dependent on agricultural productivity. Hence, efficient use of resources to enhance total agricultural productivity is key to boosting income levels and general well-being of farmers. Although Ghana is the leading producer of cocoa next to Ivory Coast, its yield (kg/ha) is below that of its competitors in the world cocoa industry. For instance, while Ghana’s average yield is about 0.4 tonnes/ha, that of Indonesia and Cote d’Ivoire are about 0.85 tonnes/ha and 0.6 tonnes/ha, respectively (FAOStat 2018). With fluctuating output levels and low yields, the efficiency of resource use has become a significant area of study in Africa’s cocoa industry, in order to increase productivity and improve farmers’ welfare in a sustainable manner. Many empirical studies (Besseah and Kim 2014; Binam et al. 2008; Onumah et al. 2013) have estimated the productivity and technical efficiency levels in cocoa production in Africa and identified sources of farmers’ inefficiencies. However, the question these and other studies in technical efficiency fail to answer is whether farm-level technical efficiency translate into welfare gains or welfare translates into technical efficiency gains. In other words, do technically efficient farmers have better welfare or does improved welfare leads to farm-level technical efficiency? Assessing the two-way effect is critical as better welfare may not necessarily lead to efficient farm management. This is because well-endowed farmers may divert their income into other non-farm activities rather than purchasing farm inputs to improve their efficiency. Moreover, though some farmers may be technically efficient, it may not be sufficient to make them “better-off” due to their scale of operations. Therefore, the two-way quantitative effects of farmers’ technical efficiency and welfare gains come into play. Building on the previous studies, this study examines the relationship between farm-level technical efficiency and farmers’ welfare (proxied by consumption expenditure per capiata). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study in the Ghanaian cocoa industry to examine the effects of technical efficiency on the welfare of farmers and the effects of welfare on technical efficiency. The study aims to establish a premise on which development efforts geared towards the efficient use of resources for improved rural farm welfare are discussed. The study also hopes to fill a gap in existing agricultural literature, particularly in the African cocoa industry.",7

P. Shafuda,Utpal Kumar De,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recent studies on economic growth and development suggest that accumulation of human capital plays an important role in enhancing economic growth as well as human development (Suri et al. 2011). The concept of human capital can be understood as a set of intangible resources needed in the labour factor to improve productivity (Goldin 2016). These are associated with knowledge and skills acquired through education, experience and healthcare (Schultz 1961; Becker 1962). Thus, Benos and Zotou (2014) defined human capital as the set of knowledge, skills, competencies and abilities embodied in individuals and acquired, through education, new learning, training, medical care and experience. Perhaps because new learning and training cannot be measured easily, health and education status has been the more commonly used human capital measures in literature on the relationship between human capital and economic growth (Ogundari and Awokuse 2018). Thus, education and health are considered as the most significant human capital investments. These two play a pivotal role in the process of economic growth. The idea of education and health as a form of human capital has emerged in the works of Schultz (1961), Denison (1962), Mushkin (1962) and Becker (1962, 1964a) which highlighted the role of education and health in human capital formation. The findings were that human capital contributed to the enhanced productivity of labour force, which later leads to growth of national income. According to the recent literature, education and good health have certain spill-over benefits other than improving productivity of labour and benefiting the individuals who receive it; in modern economies, human capital is a key determinant of economic growth. Thus, fiscal policy helps economic growth if human capital is formed in the process of infrastructure development necessary for schooling, skill development and enhancing good health of the citizens (Agenor 2008; Mekdad Dahmani and Louaj 2014). Education is considered as a long-term investment that leads to rise in productivity in future. Thus, education has positive long-run and short-run effect on economic growth (Afzal et al. 2010; Lin 2003; Tamang 2011). Baldacci et al. (2004) using data from 120 developing countries for the period 1975–2000 found long-run positive relationships between educational expenses and economic growth. Hence, studies have shown significant improvement in school attainment across the developing world in recent decades (Hanushek 2013). Despite admitting positive impact of education on economic growth, Gray et al. (2007) argued that more public spending on education and healthcare are not always associated with better educational and health outcomes. Gray (2007), however, found a positive correlation between per capita income and learning outcomes in some countries like Korea, Poland, and Romania, where better educational outcomes are associated with their levels of per capita income. Grossman (1972) developed a model in which illness prevents work so that the cost of ill health causes loss of labour time, and therefore, low productivity. So, health has been recognised as one of the fundamental elements of human capital (Bloom et al. 2001; Barro 2013). Strauss and Thomas (1998) stated that health and income mutually affect each other. Healthy communities tend to enhance physical abilities and mental clarity, which in turn increase productivity (Bloom and Canning 2000). Thus, problems affecting health cause negative shocks in growth. Whilst adequate education and good health spur a more productive labour force that could stimulate growth (Bloom et al. 2004). Ogundari and Abdulai (2014) also show that a better educated and healthier society is likely to create and adapt new technologies and consequently increase growth. Studies have also shown that health can affect growth indirectly through other variables like education, mobility and therefore skill development (Bloom and Canning, 2000; Hanushek 2013). Health status can affect educational performance as well as people’s ability to move from place to place to acquire specific training and skill. Thus, good health can be associated with increased levels of schooling and high education performance. Schooling affects ones’ ability to access the labour market. Thus, the role of improved schooling has been a central part of the development strategies of most of the countries and of international organizations. The idea of treating education and health spending as an investment decision is highlighted in the works of Becker (1962, 1964b), Bowles (1967) and Mincer (1984). Evidence is also there which reveals that the social rate of return decreases over level of education. McMahon (1997) and Green et al. (1999) suggest that investment in basic rather than higher education is a more effective strategy for skill development and eventually economic growth. Spending on education and healthcare helps promoting efficiency, knowledge and inventions, all of which contribute to the economic growth and development of a nation (Maitra and Mukhopadhyay 2012). Sen (1999) also strongly argued in support of development approach that ensures high investments in education, health and social infrastructure to accelerate growth. On the other hand, Barro (1996) found an incentive to invest in education given an increase in health indicators. Most of the studies reveal a positive impact of educational and healthcare spending by the government on social indicators (Gupta et al. 2002; Commander et al. 1997). Although a number of empirical studies found a positive relationship between healthcare and educational spending on economic growth, a few studies reveal mixed results like bidirectional or negative relationship across developing countries (Wilson 1995; Wang 2011). The Namibian healthcare and education system were designed in line with apartheid mode in the pre-independence period. Instead of providing necessary human resource base to promote equitable social and economic development across all races and ethnic groups, previously disadvantaged groups were left out. Hence, a switch in policy with emphasis on primary healthcare and basic education system was adopted. Healthcare and education were reformed to provide effective, equitable and quality health and education services to all Namibians irrespective of the colour of their skin or the tribe and religion they belong to. As a result, Namibia became one of the highest spenders on education and healthcare amongst all the developing countries (Zaaruka Biwa and Kalenga 2001; Lowet al. 2003). According to UNICEF (2017), Namibia has the third highest public education expenditure to total government spending and seventh highest education expenditure to GDP ratio amongst 115 developing countries. Kalimbo (2015) on the policy briefing report on Namibia competitiveness ranking stated that healthcare and education system remain weak in Namibia. Isaksson (2007) provided a comprehensive review on the determinants of total factor productivity with particular emphasis on the Namibian context. However, quality of the labour is determined by educational attainment and on the quality of the healthcare system. Poor quality of labour impacts productivity negatively as it has caused skill mismatch in the labour marked. The IMF (2014) notes that skills mismatch in the Namibian labour market have contributed to the persistently high level of structural unemployment. However, no substantial analysis has been made on the impact of government expenditure on healthcare and education on the related outcome and GDP growth in Namibia so far that would help in further policy formulation. The present paper thus tries to (1) analyse if government spending on healthcare and education has a long-term impact on health outcomes (mortality rate and life expectance) and on level of education outcomes (literacy rate and school enrolment rate) in the country and finally (2) to find out whether a long-run relationship exists between government spending on healthcare and education both and GDP in Namibia.",14

Shah,Sohail Amjed,Said Jaboob,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Unemployment is a universal concern of all developed and developing countries. The rate of unemployment has been mounting all over the world, especially with the recent global meltdown (Taha et al. 2017). Various policies and strategies have been adopted worldwide to reduce unemployment. Among the most chosen alternative solution to unemployment problem is entrepreneurship (Nazri et al. 2016) as entrepreneurship is increasingly considered as a significant generator of economic growth, innovation and creation of jobs (Badulescu and Badulescu 2013). However, entrepreneurship development and changing the mindset of people toward entrepreneurship is itself a challenge for almost all countries. The policymakers have adopted numerous strategies and techniques to promote entrepreneurship. One of the strategies is to provide entrepreneurship education to the people to increase the level of entrepreneurship (European Commission 2006). Entrepreneurship education provides students with the motivation, knowledge and skills that are essential for launching a successful venture (Lee et al. 2005). The purpose of entrepreneurship education is to train students to acquire skills, ideas and managerial abilities, and capacities of self-employment rather being employed for pay (Owoseni and Akambi 2010). Another objective is to help students to consider business as a career by developing positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship (Fayolle and Gailly 2008). The Sultanate of Oman is one of the most important oil-producing countries in the Middle East. The economy of the Sultanate of Oman is based on oil production and export. For the last many years, Oman is striving to diversify its economy to reduce oil dependency and reduce the ever-increasing unemployment. The Sultanate of Oman is facing a big challenge of unemployment among the youth, especially university graduates. Increased access to higher education in Oman has increased unemployment because absorbing graduates into the public sector in an expensive and unsuitable course of action and private sector is mostly occupied by expatriate workforce (Magd and McCoy 2014). The unemployment rate in Oman increased from 17.30% (2015) to 17.50% (2016). The average unemployment rate is recorded 18.34% from 1991 until 2016 (Trading Economics 2018). The labor market in Oman is currently saturated and unable to absorb the increasing number of the labor force. Therefore, the Oman government has made considerable efforts to boost and support entrepreneurship to create sufficient job opportunities by encouraging small-medium enterprises. Many supportive and motivate initiatives (financial, guiding, training and mentoring) have been taken including Intilaaqah, National Business Centre (NBC), Riyada—Public Authority for SME Development, Sas Programme, Sharakah (Fund for Development of Youth Projects), Zubair Small Enterprise Centre (Zubair SEC), CELL Program, Oman American Business Council, Injaz, Aiesec Oman and Jisser Internship Platform (Startup Oman 2018). Entrepreneurship education has also received amplified attention in Oman. Various pilot projects and national, regional or international programs have been implemented to promote entrepreneurship and to provide entrepreneurship education especially among youth, students and unemployed. The vocational training centers and colleges of technology are supporting entrepreneurship education to enhance entrepreneurial skills of graduating students. The two chains of colleges namely College of technology (under the Ministry of Manpower) and College of Applied Sciences (under the Ministry of Higher Education) are working to foster the entrepreneurship culture in the Sultanate. New courses have been offered to all students to all specializations and specific training programs on entrepreneurship skills are included in curricula (UNESCO, undated). However, the impact of changes in students’ intentions toward entrepreneurship has never been assessed which is important for policymakers. Thus, there is a need for a study to assess students’ intention toward entrepreneurship and the factors affecting their decisions. For this purpose, the study has adapted Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model and added demographic factors (independent variable) as an additional variable and entrepreneurship education as a moderating variable by proposing the conceptual framework to investigate the impact of intervening factor (entrepreneurship education) on the relationship of dependent variable (intentions) and independent variables (personal attitude, personal norms, self-efficacy and demographic). The main objective of this paper is to explore how entrepreneurial education is affecting the entrepreneurship intentions contributing to the future growth of entrepreneurship in Oman. More specific objectives are to find out how and to what extent the entrepreneurship education changes the students’ attitude, capability, skills, knowledge and intentions toward entrepreneurship, to record students’ willingness and capabilities to start their own business, to identify hindrance due to which students hesitate to start their own business and to find out the ways to stimulate and encourage student to start their own business. The rest of the paper has been organized as follows: the brief account of existing literature related to the topic is presented in Sect. 2 followed by an explanation of the conceptual framework in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the methodology adopted in the paper while results and discussion is carried out in Sect. 5. Paper is concluded in Sect. 6 with some policy implications.",49

Multiregional input–output (MRIO) models have been widely used in carbon footprint calculations as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for calculations at the national, international and global level (Wiedmann 2009b). In later years, MRIO applications have extended to a wide range of footprint analyses, such as material (Wiedmann et al. 2015; Ivanova et al. 2016; Bruckner et al. 2012; Wiebe et al. 2012), land (Ivanova et al. 2016; Steen-Olsen et al. 2012; Weinzettel et al. 2013), biodiversity (Verones et al. 2017; Lenzen et al. 2012; Wilting et al. 2017, Többen et al. 2018; Marques et al. 2019), labor (Alsamawi et al. 2014a; Simas et al. 2014), income inequality (Alsamawi et al. 2014b) and energy (Wiedmann 2009a; Owen et al. 2017). The strength of MRIO analysis as a methodology for environmental impact assessment is its ability to trace the impacts of products through the whole supply chain and attribute the impacts at different stages of production to final consumers (Moran and Wood 2014). This enables MRIO analysis to trace increasingly fragmented international supply chains across primary, secondary and tertiary producers, to give a more complete picture of the impacts of final consumption of nations, in comparison to biophysical accounting methods purely based on physical data (Bruckner et al. 2015). A drawback of MRIO analysis in environmental impact studies is the lacking resolution to trace specific products and/or materials (Schaffartzik et al. 2015) or differentiate production technologies in detail. In addition, the efforts to harmonize sectoral and regional data and satellite accounts may require additional aggregation that can compromise the accuracy of environmental and socioeconomic results (Steen-Olsen et al. 2014; Lenzen 2011). Today several global MRIO databases exist, such as Eora (Lenzen et al. 2013), WIOD (Timmer et al. 2015), GTAP-MRIO (Aguiar et al. 2016), the OECD-ICIO (Yamano and Webb 2018), and EXIOBASE (Tukker et al. 2013). Ideally, a global MRIO is as detailed as possible on both the product/industry resolution as well as on the number of explicitly represented countries. In addition, the ideal MRIO should be available as a consistent long and up-to-date time series and provide detailed socioeconomic and environmental extensions (Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013). In order to have a consistent database between different world regions, MRIO developers necessarily need to deal with aggregations of extensions, regions and sectors into a standardized classification system (Lenzen 2011). Due to lack of easily available data for many countries, the approach sometimes used to reach global coverage is by estimating “rest-of-the world regions” (RoW), which typically consist of the remaining countries that are not explicitly covered in the database. In EXIOBASE and WIOD, RoW regions comprise over one-third of the world population and 33–44% of global land use, and the aggregation of countries into regions can potentially underestimate impacts embodied in trade, in particular for highly localized pressures such as land use (Stadler et al. 2014). Discrepancies in environmental impact results across MRIOs are well-documented (Giljum et al. 2019; Owen et al. 2014, 2016; Wieland et al. 2018) and hamper the policy uptake of MRIO results (Moran and Wood 2014; Peters 2007). The robustness of MRIO compared to other methods for estimating sector-specific environmental impacts such as for land use is disputed in the literature. For instance, Schaffartzik et al. (2015) compared biophysical methods and MRIO studies on land use and found a high correlation in regional results for various land use types per capita, except for a few outliers. On the other hand, when trying to interpret MRIO results in comparison to physical trade results, Kastner et al. (2014) found that China is a major net importer of cropland products and embodied cropland in MRIO studies, while physical trade analyses show the opposite. Hubacek and Feng (2016) argue that part of this discrepancy in results between analyses based on MRIO and physical trade balances can be attributed to the differencing system boundaries and conceptual differences, and thus the methods tackle different research questions. Bruckner et al. (2015) summarize the conceptual challenges of using MRIO for attributing land use impacts, especially where aggregation is performed due to lack of product detail (Weinzettel et al. 2014) and regional detail (Stadler et al. 2014). In terms of robustness of impact assessment results from MRIOs, Su et al. (2010) find that around 40 sectors are sufficient to avoid large uncertainties in CO2 emissions embodied in exports. Comparing the impacts embodied in exports by disaggregating the SUTs of EXIOBASE at a detail of 59 sectors versus 129 sectors, Wood et al. (2014) found differences in the order of maximum 5% for labor and compensation of employees, while CO2 impacts differed up to 50%. Steen-Olsen et al. (2014) further investigated the effect of sector aggregation on CO2 multipliers (kg CO2/$) in different MRIO databases. Similar to Wood et al. (2014), they found that aggregating sectors of different MRIOs to 17 sectors significantly changed the CO2 multipliers, and that the multiplier errors increased with increased sectoral detail in the original database. Similarity in economic input structures among sectors did not imply similarity in terms of emission profiles. This advocates for high sectoral detail despite the potentially much larger compilation effort when building MRIOs. This view is supported by Lenzen (2011) who proposed that aggregating environmental extensions to sectors is a large source of uncertainty as they can be highly heterogeneous. Consequently, Lenzen (2011) proposed disaggregating input–output structures to match the detail of the environmental extensions as the best option for estimating input–output multipliers and reducing uncertainties. The effects of regional aggregation in MRIOs were studied by Bouwmeester and Oosterhaven (2013). Using EXIOBASE, they find large deviations in regional CO2 footprints (up to 22%) and water use (up to 84%) when aggregating 43 regions to four broad regions and one rest-of-the-world region. Su and Ang (2010) find that energy-related CO2 emissions are highly dependent on regional aggregation when using an MRIO of China, comparing China as a single region versus split into eight regions. Nevertheless, an earlier paper by Miller and Shao (1990) using an US MRIO model suggests that regional aggregation leads to smaller uncertainties than sectoral aggregation. In part, this is supported by de Koning et al. (2015) who found the aggregation of extensions to be more important than regional and sectoral aggregation for absolute material footprints. Although, due to a significant share of global material extraction in the global south, a more detailed regional coverage of this region in EXIOBASE has been called for by Wiebe et al. (2019). The study of regional aggregation effects due to the RoW aggregation by Stadler et al. (2014) showed that the RoW regions’ share of global land use (33–44% of the global total) are much larger than the equivalent share of global warming potential (17–22%). Furthermore, Stadler et al. (2014) found that 38% of global land exports originate in the RoW regions, underlining the need for a higher country resolution to reduce uncertainties in estimating land use embodied in trade. In terms of available MRIO databases, EXIOBASE has the highest consistent sector resolution of the available MRIO databases, but is limited in regional resolution. Eora has high country coverage and higher sector detail for some counties, but as the level of detail varies from region to region, this complicates the between-region comparison of impacts on a sectoral level. For example, Eora has only one sector aggregating all agricultural, forestry and fishing activities for most countries in the world. The GTAP-MRIO probably has the best compromise of sectoral resolution (57 sectors) and country (140 regions), but is currently not available as a time series, and has limited sectoral resolution outside the agricultural and food sectors. Ideally, there would be a MRIO database with high sector resolution, individual country coverage and a full time-series. The aim of this paper is to describe the steps towards such an improved MRIO, by increasing the country resolution of EXIOBASE 3 to explicitly including all domestic economies registered in the UN main aggregates database (214 countries, see below). We use this extended EXIOBASE (named EXIOBASE 3rx) to show the relevance of additional regional disaggregation to estimate land use embodied in trade. We study the degree of regional aggregation errors on both a regional and on a harmonized and detailed product level. In the following method section, we describe the development of EXIOBASE 3rx and present its methodological building blocks, describe the processing of land use extensions, and the method for comparing the two databases with different regional resolution. In the result section, we present land footprints and explore the degree of regional aggregation errors for land use embodied in trade. To isolate the effect of regional aggregation on land use, we compare an EXIOBASE version where the MRIO structure is pre-aggregated (aggregation of IO data before calculation of coefficients and results), referred to from now on as the aggregated database, with EXIOBASE 3rx, where the land use results of the full detailed database are aggregated to 49 regions. The implication of this work is further picked up in the next section, where we discuss our results for both MRIO development and the use of MRIO for land use studies now and in the future.",19

The earliest studies in this area started with analyzing the association between economic development and income inequality. The seminal work by Simon Kuznets (1955) focused on the association between economic growth and income inequality, and the study showed that income inequality rises during the agrarian phase of economic development, slows down during the industrial development, and declines during the rise of the service sector. Therefore, the study by Kuznets (1955) hypothesized an inverted U-shaped association between economic development and income inequality. Taking a cue from this study, a number of researchers extended this study by analyzing the association between financial development and income inequality. This extension can be explained logically. When the financial sector of any nation starts developing through several channels, namely banking and financial services sector, it directly affects the economic growth pattern and, subsequently, the distribution of income. Now, the distribution of income, which is characterized by disproportionate economic growth, is directly impacted by the development of the financial sector. On the other hand, the financial development of any nation also explains the allocation of monetary resources towards enhancing the quality of life, which is largely the basic premise of economic development. In view of this, it can be said that economic development catalyzed by financial development might have a significant impact on the distribution of income, disproportion in which might lead to income inequality. Researchers have focused on analyzing the association between financial development and income inequality. Now, this association might prove to be beneficial for a nation which is recognized by industrial growth. Owing to this reason, the present study analyzes the long-run association between financial development and income inequality in Turkey over the period 1990–2015. According to World Bank (2016a), Turkey is categorized as one of the newly industrialized countries under the next 11 categories. During 1990–2015, the global per capita income grew by nearly 1.34 times, whereas the per capita income of Turkey grew by nearly 2.27 times (World Bank 2016b). As of 2015, the global GDP growth rate was approximately 2.47%, whereas the GDP growth rate of Turkey was approximately 3.98% (World Bank 2016b). This shows the growth potential of Turkey in recent years, and owing to the pattern of this economic growth, the income inequality has been reduced by 12.19% during 1990–2015 while demonstrating dimensions of volatility (Fig. 1). It shows that the economic growth fueled by the financial development in Turkey is yet to achieve a proportionate trajectory, where the income distribution can be stabilized. The present study sheds light on this area, which has been overlooked in the existing literature. Movement of income inequality in Turkey, 1990–2015 In line with the Greenwood–Jovanovic (GJ) hypothesis (1990), the present study uses four financial development indicators and assess the impacts of those indicators on income inequality, following an inverted U-shaped framework. This study contributes to the existing literature in several ways: first, we analyze the financial development–income inequality nexus in both integrated and disintegrated ways; second, we analyze the inverted U-shaped association between financial development and income inequality for four different financial development indicators; third, we develop a comprehensive financial development index for Turkey, and analyze the financial development–income inequality nexus for Turkey following the GJ hypothesis. The results of this study confirm the GJ hypothesis for Turkey.",21

Evidence from selected South Asian countries using a new Global Infrastructure Index,December 2020,Faheem Ur Rehman,Abul Ala Noman,Yibing Ding,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Structuralists consider that availability of infrastructure plays important role in markets connectivity and trade promotion while the lack of infrastructure disrupts markets and retards trade. Infrastructure makes a huge difference in the process of development and the comparative edge of an economy, particularly in trade (Ahmad et al. 2015; Anderson and Wincoop 2003). Researchers estimated that poor infrastructure penalize international trade (Donaubauer et al. 2018; Yeaple and Golub 2002). Countries with better infrastructure (such as Singapore and Hong Kong) perform well in international trade and punch above their weight while countries with weak infrastructure (such as Bhutan and Pakistan) perform poor on external sector (Portugal-Perez and Wilson 2012). This means infrastructure is crucial for trade promotion and global economic integration (Brooks and Menon 2008). Despite the fact that infrastructure affects the cost of production and level of trade (Clark et al. 2004), many international trade theories overlooked the role of infrastructure. Traditional international trade theories assumed zero transportation and energy cost which hardly justify the ground realities at a time when infrastructure services play a dominant role in the regional as well as international trade (Djankov et al. 2010). Hoekman and Nicita (2008) argues that 10% decrease in transport costs increase trade by 6% while 10% increase in overall investment in infrastructure contribute 5% to exports in developing countries. On the other hand, lack of infrastructure increases the cost of production, reduces profitability and causes unnecessary delay in economic activities (Duval and Utoktham 2009; Martinez-Zarzose 2007). South Asian poor performance on external sector is attributed to a number of variables including lack of skilled labor, meager foreign direct investment, shortage of capital, etc.; however, rarely any study focused on the role of infrastructure despite its significant contribution to trade and business (Andrés et al. 2014; Bhattacharyay 2014). It is difficult to understand the South Asian external sector performance without understanding the role of infrastructure in the region. For example, lack of energy, transport and communication and its related infrastructure adversely affect inter-regional and international trade in South Asia (Estache and Wren-Lewis 2011; Brun et al. 2005; Limao and Venables 2001; Clark et al. 2004). Keeping in view the importance of physical infrastructure in robust external sector, Asian Development Bank report (2017) advised South Asia to focus on investment in infrastructure in order to boost exports and tackle the perennial trade deficit. Therefore, in this paper we are trying to examine does infrastructure affect international trade, particularly exports and reduce trade deficit in selected South Asian countries? Previous studies have some shortcoming to better understand the role of infrastructure in international trade by using the individual aggregate data of land line and mobile connectivity for telecommunication—and the total length of roads and the number of aircraft departures for transport infrastructure cost (for example, Ismail and Mahyideen 2015; Roller and Waverman 2001; Hoffmann 2003; Limao and Venables 2001). Some recent studies devised principal components analysis (PCA) (for example, Kumar 2006; and Francois and Manchin 2013). However, using PCA in a panel data tends to unduly restrict the set of countries and the data series that can be included in the analysis (Donaubauer et al. 2015). Therefore, in this study we use a new Global Infrastructure Index (used by Donaubauer et al. 2015) based on annual dataset of 30 indicators of the quantity and quality of infrastructure and sub-indices on transport, communication, financial and energy to better understand the role of physical infrastructure in promoting exports and curtailing trade deficit in selected South Asian countries. This study uses the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) technique to examine the long- and short-run impact of infrastructure on exports and trade deficit. The superiority of PMG procedure over other econometric technique is that it allows for both short-run and long-run results. In addition, it also suggests the speed of adjustment to the long run (Jouini 2015; Pesaran et al. 1997, 1999). We also employ the Padroni and Kao cointegration test to examine the cointegration between the variable of our interest. Fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) are also used for further robustness and to obtain long-run coefficients of cointegration. Rest of the paper is organized as: Sect. 2 presents infrastructure services and trade in South Asia, Sect. 3 reports data source and description of the variables, Sect. 4 provide the detail about econometric methodology and Sect. 5 consists of results and discussion, Sect. 6 shows robustness check with alternative methodologies, while conclusion and policy implications is accommodated in Sect. 7.",31

MRIO models are mainly used to assess the environmental and social pressures of the global economy (Wiedmann and Lenzen 2018). These models depict at a high-resolution level—country and sectorial—the international trade of goods and services, which allows them to provide detailed and useful information for stakeholders and policymakers (Wiedmann and Barrett 2013). The unit of analysis of those models is usually the country. Most of the available multiregional input–output databases provide individual country information for major economies, and one or several regional aggregations for the rest of the world (RoW). Subnational units are not considered. This situation has made room for the attempt to nest single regional input–output tables (SRIO) at a subnational level into the MRIO models. The goal is to improve the estimation of regional impacts by increasing the detail and accuracy of the relationships and dynamics between and within regional economies. Economic, social and environmental performance varies between regions because regions show different specializations patterns, inter-industry linkages (both within and across regions), population densities, workers skills, to cite only a few. These aspects determine the region’s vulnerability or resilience to economic downturns and climate change (Thissen et al. 2018) or their position and participation in global value chains (Meng and Yamano 2017). Malik et al. (2018) also highlight the need for a better understanding of within-countries effects of inter-regional interactions. These Spatially Explicit Input–Output models (SIO), as (Sun et al. 2019) called them, are relevant in the case of environmental assessments since they connect global production and trade to local environmental impacts and local consumption (Sun et al. 2019) or urban development (Zheng et al. 2019). These initiatives could be of the most interest in those cases where the region or city are a substantive part of the national economy, and its production systems are strongly intertwined in the global economy; as it happens in the case of Bogota which accounts for more than a quarter of the Colombian economy. Most of the times, the “nesting” literature rely on non-survey methods to first estimate the regional input–output data due to the lack of information at the subnational level, because full-scale surveys tend to be unaffordable and time-consuming. (Boero et al. 2018) review the most common non-survey approaches, pointing to its main assumptions, such as the technology and final demand preferences homogeneity between the region and the country, and limitations, related to the use of balancing methods that might compound existing previous estimation errors. (Sun et al. 2019) provide an extensive review of SIO focusing on the environmentally extended MRIO models and the disaggregation of final demand and the environmental extensions. Examples of nested MRIO tables have increased in recent years (Sun et al. 2019) and take two main spatial directions: region-based and city-based studies. An example of the first ones is Wang et al. (2015) for the provinces of the Chinese economy, Hasegawa et al. (2015) for Japanese regions and Athanassiadis et al. (2018) for Brussels capital region. Among the second ones, the studies are mainly directed to Chinese, Australian and Japanese cities: for Melbourne city (Wiedmann et al. 2016), Hebei’s cities (Zheng et al. 2019), for Tokyo in the context of interregional aspects of waste (Tsukui et al. 2015) or also combinations of them: five Chinese cities and five Australian cities (Chen et al. 2016). In the case of the city of Bogotá, the advantage is the disposal of a survey-based input–output table of Bogotá, which avoids the limitations related to the use of non-survey methods before the nesting procedure. This paper aims to nest the single region input–output table of the city of Bogota (Secretaria de Hacienda Distrital 2015) into the Inter-Country Input–Output (ICIO) Table provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (OCDE 2018). This will allow us to have a powerful tool in order to assess and unravel the complex relationships of Bogotá with the rest of the country and other countries of South America and the rest of the world, how the city is involved in global value chains and its sustainability.",6
9.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,03 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-020-0181-z,Tax behaviour relating to the review of a revised regional tax policy: a study in Greece,December 2020,Nikolaos Varotsis,Ioannis Katerelos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A significant proportion of Greek society has created a firm belief (Gainous et al. 2010) that tax laws are unfair and do not apply to everyone equally. This view largely stems from the inability of the public to discern, at the right time, those who attribute legitimate taxes (Robbins and Kiser 2018) versus those who evade taxes (Slemrod 2007). The main failure of the tax system in Greece is that it reproduces “tax evasion” and overdue debts of established taxes, distorting the real economy. Even continuous tax “reforms” have not stopped the continuous reproduction of tax evasion or the continuous increase of non-taxable income. The failure of the tax system is broadening as new financial accounts are recorded. The continuous growth of overdue debts highlights the failures of the tax system, although, in the last 4 years, these failures have been compounded by the constant changes in the legislative framework. The total collectability (timed payments) of income taxes, value-added tax, other indirect taxes, the real estate single tax and other real estate taxes amounted to 80.67% at the end of 2017. However, the total overdue debts at the end of 2018 exceed €104.0 billion (AADE 2019), a value that more than tripled during a decade of continuous tax reform while the total number of debtors surpassed four million. The last decade of continuous tax reform at the same level of government, which aims for monotonous collection measures to meet the annual budgetary targets, has clearly led to a fiscal fatigue of the tax base. In other words, taxable persons who are subject to taxes gradually (Young 1990) become less able to make their payment. Changes in the tax system do not increase the tax base, but instead appear to saturate the existing base. The continued production of overdue debts challenges the effectiveness of the existing tax system, as well as lasting legislative changes, exacerbating fiscal apnea. Financial resources are exhausted by perpetuating a climate of uncertainty in the growth prospects of the real economy. Economic cachexia is fuelled by rising taxes that do not achieve tax inequality by moving indirect income from categories of taxpayers who cannot conceal income (employees, pensioners, etc.) to other categories of taxpayers who persist in their delinquent behaviour while maintaining tax evasion at high levels approaching a quarter of GDP. In addition, economic apnea is maintained by the high indirect taxation that affects the inertia of economic activity (Katsimi and Moutos 2010), given that, in Greece, the value-added tax rate is the third highest among OECD countries, while it is widened by very high insurance contributions. The claim that high indirect taxation restrains economic model failures that aggravate current account performance coupled with high insurance contributions is contrasted by macroeconomic performance that does not create the appropriate growth conditions to improve the real economy. It is possible that the long-term presence of a large percentage of shadow economies in Greece—which could not restrict multiple tax reforms—is not limited to the solvency of fiscal policy but extends to the tax evasion tolerance of the whole tax base. The constant continued presence of the shadow economy in Greece does not exclude a social basis for the tax base, which has deteriorated to withstand tax evasion and survivors with high non-taxable income by adopting unpredictable tax behaviour. In this case, taxpayers’ tolerance of the shadow economy cannot be limited either by temporary intensities of tax control or by horizontal changes in the tax system. This illegal tax behaviour may include social and psychological characteristics related to the reduction of fiscal and tax policy, the management of fiscal resources and the levels of tax decentralization that contribute to maintaining the same attitude. Over the last 10 years, a new model of tax policy has been formulated with a series of regulations. Since 2019, there have been significant changes in the implementation of tax legislation with a series of legislative provisions and more than a hundred tax law codification conversions, followed by a number of circular interpretative directives which have completely revised the applicable tax policy (Naftemporiki 2017). The legislative reform of the tax model includes the Greek new income tax code (Greek Tax Code 2013a), the new tax procedure code (Greek Tax Code 2013b), the new real estate single tax and the implementation of the Greek accounting standards (Greek Tax Code 2014). The main axes of the new tax reform are presented in Fig. 1. The basic legal framework of the tax system in Greece The main objectives of the new tax reform are to simplify the monitoring of financial transactions, the submission of taxpayers’ declarations, the diversification of the imposition of penalties and the change in the control procedures and the enforcement of compulsory recovery measures. The new income tax code focuses, in conjunction with the legal framework for the prevention and suppression of money laundering (Greek Tax Code 2008), on identifying and taxing undeclared income and, in particular, income derived from illegal activities that cannot be legally justified (money laundering) or from unidentified sources of income. At the same time, it applies the mandatory application of market and real estate preservation documents. The new tax procedure code including sanctions differentiates between taxpayers while allowing for earlier tax cases to be reconciled to a lower level. Additionally, with the changes in the audit process, the tax authority is better able to interconnect through an electronic system of bank accounts and the implement a shorter process of automated seizure of bank accounts for taxpayers in public debts (O’Neill et al. 2005). With the single property tax, a uniform property tax is imposed on almost all owners, while capital gains, large immovable property and real estate transfer taxes are retained. Changes have also been made to indirect taxation by enforcing value-added tax (VAT) rates and imposing a series of additional indirect taxes (fuel, food service, telephony, etc.). The tax policy applied over the past 5 years moves on three main axes: to review the (increase) in the taxation of income or property acquired, the determination of income not only from its sources but also from living costs and the additional burden of indirect taxation. The electronic archiving of all taxpayers’ transactions has been previously established, but was not practically implemented until now. Whilst apparently the tax mix applied tightens the taxpayer (Alogoskoufis 2019), it does not consider a number of important features of a tax population dominated by high fatigue and aversion to the taxing authority due to the financial failures and injustices that have been caused by it to date. It is clear that central (government) planning and management is maintained for all tax revenues without providing for an autonomous tax governance at the regional and/or local levels (Porter 1996). This approach does not integrate the culture and social characteristics of the population to shape the new tax policy (Nantell 1999), instead insisting on the implementation of potentially successful prescriptions of other tax systems. Fiscal management remains independent of the formulation of the tax policy followed (McMillan and Woodruff 2002). Social consensus remains unknown with regard to implementing the new reforms that bring the new tax framework. Care has not been taken to remedy the injustices the tax system has brought to the population to date (according to AADE annual statistics in 2018, 90% of the income taxes are paid by 19% of the population), but only blind horizontal expansions of the tax base have been pursued. Moreover, no timetable has been provided for the modernization of all state bureaucratic procedures linked to an efficient economy in which the new tax framework will be applied. It is still unknown whether the information systems can perform all the cross-checks required to capture the financial transactions according to the total taxes paid and not simply to control their realization. However, the tax base has theoretically increased since the new tax reform provides for more taxes without having calculated the operating cost of the tax base elasticities (Bruce et al. 2006) or adjusting to the new tax base. There are three main sources of local government revenue: income from taxation, grants and loans (Easterly and Rebelo 1993). For the execution of works and the provision of services, municipalities impose taxes, fees, royalties and levies on their citizens, provided that they do not have the same tax authority but always act within the framework of a law which identifies the persons liable, the subject of taxation, rates and exemptions. In this case, the receipt and collection of income is done by the municipalities themselves, as opposed to the central resources collected from the state and attributed to the Local Authorities. A disadvantage of local taxation is the creation of horizontal and vertical fiscal disparities and inequalities in the provision of public services and taxation of citizens. The introduction of municipal taxes, fees, royalties and levies (Heymans 2006) is done by a formal law, which either imposes them automatically in favour of the first-degree municipalities (without the decision of the Municipal Council) or provides the possibility to the Local Authorities to impose them by a decision of the City Council. In the latter case, enforcement is at the discretion of the City Council (Braithwaite et al. 1987). The fees are always imposed by a decision of the Municipal Council, which determines their rate. There is still a difference in the two levels of government—central and local—in terms of the consequences of tax evasion or the income elasticity of a tax, especially if the local government imposes only a small or a single tax. A substantial difference is observed in the economic operation of the two levels of administration. The central government functions more as a means of ensuring economic stability and redistribution of income in relation to the local government (Weingast 1995), and they do not have a correspondingly important role. Thus, a tax may seem more appropriate in terms of effectiveness and fiscal justice when applied centrally than at local level. Tax decentralization is the extent to which the central government transfers a tax burden to a local authority (Davulis et al. 2013) and is valued based on the percentage of local government tax revenues in the total public tax revenues, or by comparing local government revenue with that of the local government’s central administration. In this case, the question arises as to the distinction between tax revenues belonging to the tax-collecting step and those belonging to that level, in favour of which they are charged by another level of administration. A significantly higher degree of decentralization is found in the Nordic countries (Tøssebro et al. 2012), and particularly in Denmark (Iversen 1996), where local government revenue reaches 81.46% of central government revenue. As shown in Fig. 2 below, the structure of fiscal decentralization varies across 15 countries in Europe (Council of Europe 2000): Source: European Commission (2017) Percentage of local government revenue in central government revenue Figure 3 below shows the situation in the European states as regards the percentage structure of local government revenues. As shown in Fig. 3, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal secure the bulk of their revenue from non-tax revenues such as subsidies and borrowing. Source: European Commission (2017) Synthesis of local government revenue In the European Union, the composition of budgetary resources has not changed over time. As seen from Fig. 4 there is a slight increase in government intervention in central level (European Commission 2017). Source: European Commission (2017) Revenue distribution structure at central, state and local level Individual tax behaviour (Katerelos and Varotsis 2017) often deviates from the rational model (Conlisk 1996) to reward personal well-being. Individual behaviour and decision-making (Edwards 1954) differ from rational selection by enhancing personal heuristics with cognitive constraints (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). The sovereign characteristics of the taxpayer are to adopt rational self-esteem for personal material satisfaction. Tax evasion occurred alongside taxes (Kirchler et al. 2008) influenced by perceived justice in the tax system (Andreoni et al. 1998). Compliance with tax rules is a priority for public finances and affects equality, efficiency and ultimately the impact of a tax system. When a significant proportion of the population can avoid or fail to systematically pay or not pay the corresponding taxes, the tax system becomes unfair, punishing honest taxpayers by imposing additional necessary taxes. On the other hand, the tax distorts the effectiveness of the tax system (Kaplow 1996), impacting the welfare of taxpayers (Cullis and Lewis 1997). The imposition of increased tax rates and the ingenuity of taxing is too simple to achieve economic growth in a socio-economic system (Murphy 2008), and may lead to a temporary increase in tax revenues using tax models with low social efficiency (Wenzel 2004). Maintaining a “marginal” behaviour among the population with mixed strategies to temporarily respond to taxes implies adjusting to a pattern of avoidance of taxes (Méder et al. 2012). In addition, a taxation system of over-filing is fully exploited, with unspecified effects on the real economy. Excessive taxation not only leads to the tax exhaustion of the population but also sparks social reactions for a so-called ineffective government. A tax system acceptable to the taxpayer is a prerequisite for an effective tax policy (Laffer 2004). Social consensus is an agreement about the need for a commonly accepted social goal (Wood 1989; Weller 2007) by all parties involved. Social consensus, also referred to as functionality, is based (Keltner and Kring 1998) on self-preservation and the social responsibility of societies (Sutinen and Kuperan 1999), which are balanced by social acceptance in order to maintain the existing social order. Social consensus contradicts (Ross et al. 1977) conflict practice (Lane 1976), which requires a modification of the existing social establishment in order to make changes. Social consensus aims to balance society through a common agreement (Peredo and McLean 2006) on rules, values and operating rules in a specific context. Tax reform is an indispensable component of state reform, a method (OECD 2010) chosen by an elected government for fiscal improvement with a view towards collecting taxes and the quality of public services. Reform is achieved by simplifying financial control, changing the progressivity of tax rates, imposing acceptable taxes, removing ineffective existing taxes, widening the tax base, and simplifying the collection of taxes (Slemrod 2001). State reform aims at simplifying citizens’ transactions with the state, improving the quality of government services and the functioning of public services (Matei and LazĂR 2011) for the benefit of citizens (Allan and Scruggs 2004), improving the system (Perez and Westrup 2010) and improving the effectiveness of public works in terms of financial requirements and conditions. The efficiency of the tax system and the efficiency of the state contribute to the efficient management of the available financial resources and bring about economic growth. It is a key factor of economic prosperity, social cohesion and the basic survival factor of an independent democratic state (Anderson 2001). The effectiveness of the tax system depends on the economic environment, as well as on the social characteristics of taxpayers (Varotsis and Katerelos 2018). The sustainability of a tax system consists of a fair distribution of the tax burden relative to actual income (van Dijke and Verboon 2010). Pre-socialization of social justice by selfishness for taxation is the central factor for the effectiveness of a tax model (Fehr and Schmidt 1999). A fair distribution of tax burdens is a precursor to the taxpayer’s compromise, with a consistent behaviour toward his tax obligations, while stressing the importance of a fair tax system (Barth et al. 2013).",3

That development was in contrast to the prevailing classical view about the working principles of the invisible hands of demand and supply that interplay to create necessary adjustments in relation to output determination and employment (Johnson et al. 2001; Shaikh 2009; Backhouse 2015). There are two major categories of economic policies that have been widely utilized over a vast period of time for the general purpose of economic stabilization and for the achievement of some essential macroeconomic goals and objectives in specific terms. These policies are fiscal and monetary. Although the two policies are different in terms of their structure and the application of their fundamental instruments, however, they are generally targeted at achieving similar goals and objectives of maintaining economic stability in most nations (Beetsma and Jensen 2005; Claeys 2006). While the latter is generally a formidable instrument in the hands of the apex bank of various nations, the former exists as an important economic instrument in the hands of the governments of various nations. Fiscal policies are government policies that are strategically designed to regulate or stabilize the economy through various forms of taxes and expenditures. They are economic policies that integrate government strategies for generating revenue basically via taxation and its subsequent strategies for making decisions on how the corresponding revenue that is generated would be allocated for attaining targeted economic goals. According to Jhingan (1997), fiscal policy aims at ensuring long-run economic stability by the adjustments of short-run economic fluctuations in such a way that a government uses its expenditure and revenue programs to generate desirable effects while avoiding those effects that are undesirable on a nation’s income production, and employment levels. There are various factors that might be contributing to incremental public expenditures in many nations based on empirical evidences. Hong and Nadler (2015) identified growing sources of government revenue as one major factor that could contribute to incremental public expenditures. Some other studies like Remmer (2004), Ouattara (2006) and Asongu and Jellal (2016) have also shown that factors like access to foreign aid and grants could as well promote incremental public expenditure and this is often witnessed in the majority of low-income countries. The role of the Nigerian government in economic activities has grown enormously and the challenges that public policymakers face are increasing day by day. Public expenditures have been growing continuously over the years and more especially in the last two decades. The total of both capital and recurrent expenditure of the government grew sporadically from about ₦60.25 billion (about $7.49 bn) in 1990 to about ₦3.99 trillion ($39.07 bn) in 2010 (CBN 2017). Huge chunks of the Nigerian federal government expenditure have been channeled into recurrent expenditure over the years due to some factors such as expansion in size of the civil service and disproportionate emoluments for political office holders among others. Recurrent expenditure grew from ₦36.21 billion (about $4.5 bn) in 1990 to about ₦3.109 trillion (about $20.68 bn) by the year 2010. Capital expenditures also witnessed some changes during these periods as the total capital expenditure grew at a decreasing rate from ₦24.04 billion (about $2.9 bn) in 1990 to ₦234.45 billion (about $2.29 bn) in 2000 and as at 2010, capital expenditure has risen to ₦883.87 billion (about $5.88 bn). However, as of 2010, recurrent expenditures alone accounted for over 75% of the total government expenditures (CBN 2017). There is no doubt with regards to the pattern of transformation that public spending has witnessed over the years in Nigeria. However, the question of whether these increments in public spending have translated into desired economic growth and prosperity of the people is still yet to be answered. Cases of corruption and mismanagement of public funds have stalled the chances of making adequate budget appropriation and execution of capital projects and this has left the country in a state of huge infrastructural gaps thereby, creating a cog in the wheels of the nation’s economic growth. Furthermore, there have been changes in the dynamics of the demand for public services with respect to the demographic explosion that has generated more pressure on the available insufficient social amenities. Shelton (2007) noted that growing population and problems associated with urbanization often exacerbate the pressure for the government to increase public expenditures. Earning revenue is very important, at the same time; we are of the opinion that channeling the revenue to create the right impact on the economy by achieving desirable macroeconomic goals and objectives is a more paramount matter that needs to be addressed. Thus, this study re-examines the impacts of government spending on economic growth in the Nigerian economy context while considering the divergent opinions from the existing literature. Furthermore, the study also provides more insight into the government expenditure-led growth literature that hinges partly on debt financing in relation to the private sector spending effect in the economy. The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides insights into expansionary and contractionary fiscal policies while the attendant literature is covered in Sect. 3. The methodology and data are discussed in Sect. 4, whereas Sect. 5 discloses the empirical results. Section 6 concludes with implications are future research directions.",54
9.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,01 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-020-0189-4,"On the simultaneous openness hypothesis: FDI, trade and TFP dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa",December 2020,Simplice A. Asongu,Joseph Nnanna,Paul N. Acha-Anyi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The objective of this research is to assess the relevance of trade dynamics in moderating the effect of foreign investment on productivity dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study is tailored within the context of a simultaneous hypothesis such that foreign direct investment (FDI) is complemented with dynamics of trade to influence productivity. Accordingly, it is an improved framing of the Rajan and Zingales (2003) position that concurrent opening of trade and capital accounts will lead to greater output in a domestic economy. Moreover, the problem statement underlying this exposition is motivated within the broader context of: (i) debates in the contemporary literature on the relevance of total factor productivity (TFP) and (ii) gaps in the attendant literature. These motivational elements are expanded in the following passages. First, no consensus is apparent in the literature on the relevance of productivity in development outcomes in Africa. In essence, while a strand of studies posits that aggregate productivity is essential in boosting economic development, authors are still divided on the mechanisms through which productivity can be boosted (Elu and Price 2010; Baliamoune 2009; Baliamoune-Lutz 2011; Asongu 2013; Asongu 2014a; Ssozi and Asongu 2016a; Tchamyou 2017; Cheruiyot 2017). Among conflicting perspectives, a debate that is worth mentioning is one that centres on factor accumulation and TFP. One group, building on examples and success stories of East Asia posit that the relevance for factor accumulation is higher compared to TFP in the prosperity of nations (Young 1995; Asongu 2017). Conversely, another group of authors is of the perspective that, cross-country differences in economic outcomes are significantly traceable to disparities or variations in cross-country levels of TFP (Abramovitz 1986; Romer 1986, 1993; Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997; Temple 1999; Nelson and Howard Pack 1999; Easterly and Levine 2001; Durlauf et al. 2005). As maintained by Devarajan et al. (2003), the African poverty tragedy is accounted for more, by low TFP than it is by investment levels. The authors caution on the importance of prioritizing TFP in place of investments in order to lift the continent out of poverty. This research contributes to the growing debate by assessing how trade openness can modulate FDI to influence TFP dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This positioning is also buttressed by a corresponding gap in the scholarly literature. Second, to the best of our knowledge, scholarship on the main variables of interest in the study can be engaged in two main strands, pertaining to TFP- and FDI-centric studies. The first on TFP-oriented scholarship has fundamentally focused on, inter alia: gender disparities and labour supply in SSA (Elu and Price 2017); the rate of child labour and schooling features (Ahouakan and Diene 2017); linkages between manufacturing and exports (Cisse 2017); examinations of nexuses between manufacturing firms and TFP within the framework of variations of productivity prosperity across sectors in the manufacturing industry (Kreuser and Newman 2018) and the importance of information technology in TFP convergence (Maryam and Jehan 2018). The second pertaining to FDI-centric research includes: regional income convergence and FDI (Dunne and Nicholas Masiyandima 2017); how portfolios in Africa’s economic sectors are influenced by more globalized sectors (Boamah 2017); nexuses between concepts underlying equity, bonds, institutional debts and economic prosperity (Fanta and Makina 2017); modelling output gaps in view of future economic prosperity (Fedderke and Mengisteab 2017) and how value chains are relevant in boosting the influence on economic growth and TFP (Meniago and Asongu 2019). The study that is closest to the present exposition is Sakyi and Egyir (2017) which has focused on the simultaneous openness hypothesis with particular emphasis on interactions between trade openness and FDI for economic growth in the continent of Africa. The authors assess the hypothesis that positive ramifications in terms of economic growth can be derived from interactions between exports and FDI. The geographical and temporal scopes are, respectively, 45 African countries and the period spanning from 1990 to 2014. Using the Generalized Method of Moments (i.e. GMM), the findings reached by the authors support the tested hypothesis. This study steers clear of Sakyi and Egyir (2017) from a number of fronts. (i) Within a methodological perspective, this research adopts the GMM option that is based on forward orthogonal deviations because compared to the system GMM option used by the underlying study, the approach adopted in this research has been documented to produce more reliable estimated coefficients because, it among others, diminishes instrument proliferation which has been established to bias estimated coefficients in the attendant contemporary GMM-centric literature (Meniago and Asongu, 2018; Tchamyou et al. 2019; Tchamyou 2020). For instance, the information criteria disclosed by the underlying study does not provide insights into this concern of instrument proliferation because the number of instruments and corresponding number countries are not disclosed for each specification, to enable an examination of whether specifications are biased by the presence of instrument proliferation. (ii) Instead of focusing on economic growth, this research is concerned with TFP dynamics. (iii) Contrary to the assessment of the tested simultaneous openness hypothesis on the premise of marginal, interactive or conditional effects, this research considers net effects (constituting both the conditional and unconditional effects) as an information criterion in the assessment of the simultaneous openness hypothesis. In essence, as emphasized by Brambor et al. (2006) on the setbacks of interactive specifications, both the conditional and unconditional impacts are relevant for the assessment of how the modulating variables interact with the main independent variable of interest to influence the outcome variable. This conception and understanding of the relevance of net effects in interactive regressions is consistent with the attendant contemporary literature on interactive specifications (Tchamyou and Asongu 2017; Agoba et al. 2020; Tchamyou 2019). (iv) This research also takes on board some prevailing concerns pertaining to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are quite imperative in the post-2015 development agenda. Accordingly, departing from the strand of TFP literature which has fundamentally been based on one indicator of TFP, this research is consistent with concerns of inclusive productivity and output by adopting inclusive TFP measurements to complement the mainstream TFP indicator, namely: real TFP, welfare TFP and real welfare TFP. Hence, it also departs from Asongu et al. (2020) by focusing on TFP instead of economic growth dynamics. The remainder of the study is structured as follows. This introduction is followed by a section on theoretical underpinnings surrounding, on the one hand, the role of openness in economic development and on the other, the importance of FDI in TFP. A section covering the data and methodology comes after these theoretical insights, followed by an empirical results section in which the findings are presented and discussed. The study concludes in the last section with implications and future research directions.",7

ILO (2020) expects the largest amount of youth unemployment at the global level to take place in manufacturing, real estate, wholesale, and accommodation sectors (see Table 1). This calls for the generation of information about the underlying properties of sectoral linkages in production networks to respond to and recover from the pandemic. This paper addresses the information need by developing a novel graph-theoretic method, which has been specifically designed to identify and characterize upstream and downstream pathways of a targeted sector in ways that help recovery from a shock to the production network. The method is applied to characterize production networks of China, Japan, India, Russia, Germany, Turkey, UK and USA, which together account for about 60 percent of the world GDP, and generate information for informed policy making to address the adverse effects of the pandemic. The objective is not to estimate the output effects of the pandemic-related unemployment derived from the multiplier analysis but to elaborate on the ILO’s unemployment estimates and provide critical information that can be used in policy interventions aimed to recover from the negative output effects of the pandemic. For example, ILO forecasts a substantial amount of unemployment in the manufacturing sector due to the COVID-19 related loss of working hours, while our paper generates information from the past input–output data that can be employed in the design of policy interventions aimed to minimize or avoid such unemployment, and thereby offer ways to recover the projected output lossssuch information is the identification of significant upstream and downstream pathways of the targeted manufacturing sector; a second piece of information is the specific grouping of sectors supporting the manufacturing sector (i.e., community structure of the manufacturing sector); a third piece of information is the critical binary links connecting several communities (i.e., betweenness) when the manufacturing sector is targeted. Knowledge of these network relations centered around the manufacturing sector can be used to formulate employment and growth strategies. The empirical analysis uses IO data from 2015, which is the most recent available data in OECD database. Therefore, our paper assumes that the properties of a production system in 2015 of a country remained unchanged during the period 2015–2020. The employment strategies elaborated in what follows should be interpreted relative to the 2015 IO properties of the country examined. The findings show that manufacturing (MA2) is top priority sector to be targeted in all the eight countries, followed by real estate (EST) and wholesale (WHS) sectors, and that these sectors should be coupled with isolated communities of sectors to capture external employment effects from the interacting communities (or clusters). Naturally, sector coupling would vary across countries, depending on the linkages between the communities identified. This paper is organized in five sections. Following the Introduction, Section 2 presents a brief review of the literature to position and motivate the current paper, pointing out, where it contributes to the literature by developing a new method for characterizing a targeted sector with its upstream and downstream pathways. Section 3 describes the new method and the three network concepts used in the analysis. Section 4 applies the method using the 2015 IO data for eights countries. Drawing on the results from Section 4, Section 5 discusses how to integrate the new information obtained from partial sectoral analysis into wider employment policy interventions. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

10.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,17 December 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-021-00257-1,Global and regional shock transmission: an Asian perspective,December 2021,Nagendra Shrestha,Kiyotaka Sato,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In September 2008, the world plunged into the unprecedented global financial crisis (GFC), accompanied by a deep decline in world trade. The United States experienced the most severe downturn in trade in terms of the magnitude and speed since the late 1960s (Crowley and Luo 2011). This unprecedented collapse of world trade in 2008–2009 is referred to as the “Great Trade Collapse”. According to Table 1, US imports from the selected Asian and European countries fell rapidly from the 4th quarter of 2008 through the end of 2009. US imports from Japan and Malaysia became a negative growth in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and Japan appears to have been the most severely affected by the US import decline. Table 2 shows the GDP growth rate in 2009 and changes in exportsFootnote 1 to the world in selected countries from 2008 to 2009. Germany and Japan (− 5.6 and − 5.5%, respectively) experienced largest negative GDP growth, whereas China was affected marginally by GFC with 9.2% of GDP growth. In the meantime, Chinese gross export of manufacturing goods declined substantially ($207.1 billion) due to GFC compared to Japanese gross export of $176.0 billion. Therefore, it is quite unrealistic to explain the effect of GFC on GDP growth with respect to gross export shock. However, decline in finished goods export of Germany ($134.1billion), Japan ($112.1billion) and China ($72.2 billion) seems to be inter-related with respective GDP growths. Further, industry-breakdown of finished goods export shows Japan’s finished goods export of transport equipment industryFootnote 2 (mainly motor vehicles) and China’s electric machinery industryFootnote 3 are by far the largest in Asia. This paper attempts to answer why Japanese GDP was worst hit by GFC and China was affected only marginally, even though China plays a central role of regional processing trade in Asia, especially in the electric machinery industry (Koopman et al. 2008, 2012, and Athukorala 2009). One useful approach is to utilize the International Input–Output (IIO) table, where bilateral trade linkages are decomposed into two types of trade, i.e., transactions of intermediate inputs and final goodsFootnote 4 at a detailed industry level. While it was generally hard to obtain the updated time-series data on the IIO table,Footnote 5 in recent years numerous attempts have been made on the construction of the time-series IIO tables.Footnote 6 In particular, dissemination of World Input–Output Database (WIOD) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inter-Country Input–Output (ICIO) Tables are expected to contribute significantly to the research on economic linkage.Footnote 7 We develop unique international input–output tables named as Global Input–Output (henceforth, YNU-GIO or GIO) tables to answer the research question of this paper. Followings are major differences between our data and other data sources. First, we attempt to capture the intermediate goods trade structure from as many countries (29 endogenous, 59 exogenous countries and Rest of the World) as possible so that we can measure the degree of shock transmission through change in demand of intermediate goods (i.e., along backward linkage direction). Unlike WIOD and ICIO, we do not treat Rest of the World as a single endogenous economy because there is higher possibility to overestimate backward and forward linkages due to endogenous treatment of Rest of the World. Further, combining countries with significantly different economic structures into one endogenous block (i.e., ROW), biases may occur in the result. Second, a major advantage of the YNU-GIO table is to include 11 Asian countries as an endogenous country and to construct annual tables from 1997 to 2012. WIOD does not include most ASEAN countries as an endogenous country, which is a major disadvantage to the study of Asian economic linkages. To anticipate the results, we show that there is an asymmetric pattern of shock transmission between Japan and other Asian countries. Japanese finished goods exports are affected substantially by the global shock, especially in the transport equipment industry, but the shock is not transmitted globally or regionally from Japan in terms of both intermediate inputs and value-added contents. In addition, the global shock that is transmitted to Japan tends to be absorbed in Japanese domestic sectors. As a manufacturing hub, China plays a major role in supplying intermediate inputs regionally and globally, especially in the electric machinery industry, which enhances the degree of regional economic integration in Asia and also inter-regional linkages between Asia, North America and Europe. However, China’s value-added transmission index to the world is comparatively higher than that of Japan, implying that Japan is more vulnerable to regional and world demand shocks than China and other countries. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methods to estimate the new indices of shock transmission and the data construction of the YNU-GIO tables, and Sects. 3 and 4 present the results of the shock transmission analysis and discuss the results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) encourages the extension of IOTs or SUTs to improve the accuracy of its Trade in Value Added (TiVA) indicators by reflecting differences in the ratio of imported to total intermediate goods across heterogeneous firms in an industry. For the calculation of TiVA, it is important to estimate the amount of imported intermediate goods as accurately as possible, as this is essential for calculating foreign value added. In the OECD’s expert group on extended input–output tables (EIOTs) established in 2014, experts from various countries have discussed which elements of firm heterogeneity should be incorporated in EIOTs (Johnson and Noguera 2012; Ito et al. 2017). Thus far, the OECD has proposed assessing heterogeneity between exporters and non-exporters, domestically and foreign-owned, and large and small firms, in addition to firms with and without foreign subsidiaries (OECD 2015), as presented in Table 1. In this context, this study considers the kind of firm heterogeneity that should be incorporated in Japan’s EIOT. The research then examines the usefulness of such extension by estimating the vertical specialization (VS) indicator of Japan, which corresponds to TiVA’s foreign value added included in Japan’s exports. The remainder of this paper is organized into three sections. Section 2 introduces methods, Subsection 3.1 discusses heterogeneity between exporters and non-exporters, and Subsection 3.2 that between large and small firms. Next, Subsection 3.3 focuses on domestically and foreign-owned firms, and Subsection 3.4 that firms with and without foreign subsidiaries. Subsection 3.5 describes the challenges of compiling Japan’s EIOT, after determining an element of firm heterogeneity that produces the largest gap of imported intermediate ratio for each industry. In Subsection 3.6, Japan’s VS indicators are calculated to examine the usefulness of the constructed EIOT. Section 4 concludes.",

Colombia, as one of the countries experiencing one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America over the past decades, has developed a dynamic policy of trade openness in order to promote its economic development through the promotion of its exports. Nonetheless, although the trade openness policy has been defined by different studies as a successful policy to improve bilateral trade, this has been widely questioned in Colombia. The nation’s trade balance, which has historically been in deficit, has deepened further in recent years, presenting one of the largest imbalances in Latin America after only Mexico and Argentina (ECLAC 2020). Based on this negative trend established within a context of complex socioeconomic factors, such as high rates of informality, greater concentration of wealth, controversial electoral processes, drug trafficking and internal armed conflict, among others related to governance, this study attempts to evaluate the effect of Colombian institutional quality on its export trade flows. The results will allow us to simultaneously infer the extent to which the quality of Colombian governance affects its exports, and to present the findings of a study that could be replicated in similar Latin American countries. Consequently, the findings of the study will allow us to offer some policy suggestions to address overcoming the deficiencies related to governance in Colombia. This paper contributes to previous research into the influence of governance on international trade, with a focus on emerging economies that have followed the path of trade liberalisation promoted by developed economies. This study is the first to address the effect of institutional quality on exports from a country like Colombia, which has been deeply affected by a long internal armed conflict that has affected the numerous efforts made by national authorities over recent decades to improve their governance indices. We apply the trade gravity model to a cross-sectional dataset of bilateral exports between Colombia and 136 countries from 2005 to 2018, before we then use a group of institutional quality indices elaborated by the World Bank (WB) to test the influence on Colombian exports, firstly, from the institutions, and, secondly, from the institutional distance between Colombia and its trading partners. Furthermore, we include variables based on the new trade theory framework to assess the endogenous characteristics of the exporting country and the effect of them on trade flows. Finally, the econometric model is estimated by the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) approach (Silva and Teneyro 2006), which is the most suitable econometric procedure in the presence of a large number of zeros, potential endogeneity, and econometric drawbacks. This paper is organised as follows. The first part describes the influence of institutions on international trade, as well as the performance of Colombian exports and the country’s institutional quality over recent decades. The second part of this paper will present the methodological approach, specification, and research data. Finally, it will offer its findings, focussing on the discussion and central conclusions.",10

On the other hand, a lack of investment has undermined economic growth in underdeveloped countries. Discrepancies among the financial systems of developed and developing countries hinder the global redistribution of funds. Both financial and real sectors should be considered in analyzing the global economy. Financial transactions and trades are two sides of the same coin. Financial transactions among the entities of multiple countries make up the global financial market, whereas international trade reflects the real economy. As is well known, international input–output tables that measure the real sector have been developed. However, statistics for international financial relations remain undeveloped. Flow of funds accounts (FFAs) are official statistics describing fund transfers and asset/liability holdings within and outside a country. Global FFAs depict the cross-border transfer of funds at the international level and the countries' consequent claim/obligation relations. Although the original idea of global FFAs is seen in pioneering works, such as that of Ishida (1993), worldwide currency and financial crises, especially the 2008 global financial crisis, have shed new light on the importance of global FFAs. The Financial Crisis and Information Gaps, Report to the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governor, or the so-called G20 Data Gap Report, was published in 2009 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff and the Financial Stability Board Secretariat to frame a guideline for filling the data gap between existing and necessary statistical assets of the global financial system, and the development of global FFAs was set as its key objective. The development of global FFAs has been primarily driven by the IMF, which is responsible for monitoring global financial system functions. For example, in line with the global FFA scheme of Errico et al. (2013, 2014), the IMF has worked on improving relevant international statistics, such as those of the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS). Global FFAs, however, have not yet been produced, mainly due to the absence of national “from-whom-to-whom” FFAs to be combined as the integral segments of global FFAs.Footnote 1 Against this backdrop, this paper considers the possibility and relevance of compiling global FFAs, particularly extending the compilation to international “from-whom-to-whom” financial stock (FFS) tables. Such a compilation would be based on information obtained from a series of dialogs with experts of the IMF as well as the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, the (US) Federal Reserve, and Statistics Canada, each of which is responsible for compiling its respective country’s FFAs. In the next section, we first present a method for transforming national FFAs into FFS tables and then show how the consequent FFS tables are integrated with CPIS, CDIS, and other international statistics within the framework of an international FFS table, with a particular focus on the Asia–Pacific Region. We later discuss the potential use of an international FFS table in input–output analysis. Previous research has analyzed international flows of funds. For example, Tsujimura and Tsujimura (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011) constructed tables for financial transactions among multiple countries. Zhang (2005, 2009, 2015) and Zhang and Zhao (2019) built global flow of funds models comprising the financial instruments of major countries and estimated several multiple-equation models. Schumacher (2019) analyzed intercountry credit and savings to evaluate the effects of credit defaults. The authors’ previous study, Hagino et al. (2018), converted the FFAs of Japan, Korea, the United States, and Canada into FFS tables and compiled an international FFS table connecting the four countries and representing a preliminary global FFA focused on the Asia–Pacific Region. In doing so, the authors exchanged views with experts from the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, the US Federal Reserve Board, and Statistics Canada, who are compilers of their countries’ FFAs, as well as at the IMF, to discuss a method of converting countries’ FFAs into FFSs and putting those FFSs, CPISs, CDISs, and other international statistics into a global FFS framework. For a future project, we propose including China, Brazil, and Chile, as well as Indonesia and Colombia, which have been developing their FFAs, to compile a comprehensive Asia–Pacific FFS. We also exchanged views with researchers at the National Accounts Institute of Beijing Normal University Measurement regarding the contemplated future project. With the goal in mind of including China in the Asia–Pacific FFS, it was suggested that the most important obstacle is the absence of stock data for China’s FFA, in addition to obstacles derived from the relatively slow pace of China’s statistics development in CPIS and CDIS. Under these circumstances, the authors decided to estimate a stock table of China’s FFA and then compile an FFS table as described in the work of Hagino et al. (2018), aiming to include China in the Asia–Pacific FFS. In this respect, it may be efficient to replace Canada, which was included in the preliminary Asia–Pacific FFS of Hagino et al. (2018), with China. Compiling Canada’s FFS required many assumptions due to a lack of source data, while China’s slow development in CPIS and CDIS implies that mirror data of China’s partner countries may be used. Thus, the new Asia–Pacific FFS will consist of Japan, Korea, the United States, and China. This paper attempts to achieve this goal by producing a stock table for China’s FFAs as of year-end 2015 and examining the use of various financial data. Hagino et al. (2019) estimated an FFS table for Japan, Korea, the United States, and China. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the basic concept and framework of the FFA. After converting FFAs into FFSs for Japan, Korea, the United States, and China, a new Asia–Pacific international FFS as of year-end 2015 is demonstrated. Section 3 analyzes power and sensitivity indexes using an input–output analysis method and describes features of asset and liability portfolios. Finally, Sect. 4 presents the conclusion and prospects for future projects.",

To do so, MRIO links national inter-industry accounts with international trade data (Tukker et al. 2018). Although extensive inter-regional trade information is available, they often lack the required level of detail needed to compile MRIO tables without having to rely on strong assumptions (Rodrigues et al. 2016; Dietzenbacher et al. 2013). MRIOs are commonly build from rectangular Multi-Regional Supply and Use Tables (MRSUTs) which are then converted to symmetric MRIO tables (see Eurostat 2008 for more details). The compilation of MRSUTs requires information on the use (or consumption) of product i from region a in the target sector j in region b for all regions, products and target sectors covered by the MRSUT. The target sector can either be an individual industry (intermediate consumer) or a final consumer (typically distinguishing households, government and capital formation). However, data on imported inputs are not available at the level of individual industries and final demand categories but by “Broad End-use Category” BEC (OECD 2020). As the name implies the BEC classification system only broadly distinguishes between intermediate consumption, household consumption, capital goods and mixed end-use (products where the end-use is unclear e.g. cars can be purchased both for household consumption and as capital goods). In effort to overcome this lack of information, MRIO/MRSUT compilers proportionally distribute the imported commodities over the target sectors in the importing region so that an exporting region’s share of the total import volume of a product is the same for each target sector (see Fig. 2D). This assumption is often referred to as the “proportionality assumption” (Rodrigues et al. 2016; Peters et al. 2011). The proportionality assumption underlies all current global MRIO tables, however the level at which the proportionality assumption is applied varies. EXIOBASE (Stadler et al. 2018), Eora (Lenzen et al. 2013) and GTAP (Peters et al. 2011) for instance allocate imports to the target sectors without the differentiation in intermediate use, consumption, and capital (i.e. not using BEC data) thus using the same proportions for all target sectors be it industries or final consumers. WIOD, by contrast, take the BEC data to distribute imports to aggregate end-use sectors but then also use the same proportions for all industries and final demand categories, respectively (Dietzenbacher et al. 2013). One reason why only WIOD uses the BEC data is that the BEC data by no means covers all industries, countries and years at the resolution required to produce such high resolution MRIOs as EXIOBASE or Eora. Although the assumption that imports are distributed proportionally among individual industries and end-consumers might provide a practical solution to the lack of more detailed data, the assumption might be flawed for several reasons, possibly resulting in biased MRIO-based results. In the following, we first address some aspects that could lead to ‘real’ import shares differing significantly from the proportionality assumption. We then work out the conditions which additionally must be fulfilled so that assuming proportional import shares in such situations leads to a bias in the MRIO results. One reason why the proportionality assumption might be flawed is the aggregation bias: due to the aggregation of firms to broader industry sectors, one such a sector might include rather heterogeneous products (in terms of physical properties and/or prices) (Majeau-Bettez et al. 2016). In EXIOBASE for example, raw unfabricated leather products and luxury leather handbags are aggregated into one “Leather and leather products” sector (Stadler et al. 2018). Imagine three countries: Country a and b both export leather and leather products to country c. However, a is specialised in raw leather, while b exports mainly luxury leather handbags. In country c two industries i and j use imported leather, however, sector i buys raw leather from country a (to further process it), while sector j imports luxury leather handbags from country b (to retail them). However, since this knowledge on the exact use of imports is not available for MRIO compilers, they assume that for both industries i and j the shares of imported leather products coming from country a and b, respectively, are the same. Depending on the application case this assumption of proportional import shares could lead to biases in the outcome of MRIO studies if further conditions are met: If a MRIO is used to study the environmental implications at the level of industry or product sectors [e.g. study the footprint of sector i (Wiedmann et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2009), or of a consumption basket (Hardadi et al. 2020; Ivanova et al. 2016)], the proportionality assumption biases the outcome when there is a large variation in the impact intensities between the products of the exporting countries. Presumably, the cheap raw leather products from country a have a higher carbon emission intensity (i.e. emissions per Euro) than the expensive luxury leather handbags from country b. Hence sector i’s carbon footprint would be underestimated because the upstream emissions related to i’s use of imported leather products are averaged among both importing countries, instead of taken from the carbon intense leather sector of country a. If a MRIO practitioner is interested in the environmental implications at the national level (e.g. Schmidt et al. 2019), a large variation in the impact intensities between the products of the exporting countries, however, is not yet sufficient to lead to a bias in the results. Then additionally the products of industries i and j have to differ in terms of what proportion is consumed domestically and what proportion is exported. If industry i (importing from a) mainly produces for export, while j’s luxury leather handbags are mainly for the domestic market, the proportionality assumption would lead to an overestimation of c’s national carbon footprints because the upstream emissions related to industry j’s use of imported leather products would partly incorporate emissions which are actually linked to i’s leather imports (which should not show up in the footprint of country c since i produces for export). There exist also other reasons why imports might not be distributed proportionally among target sectors. These are, for example, geographical reasons, e.g. the location of firms from one sector closer to large harbours or towards the border to a neighbouring country, or historically grown trade relations between firms in different countries. Even though several MRIO compilers mention the potential problems related to the proportionality assumption (Stadler et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2011; Lenzen et al. 2013; Dietzenbacher et al. 2013), so far only few studies approached the problem quantitatively. Puzzello (2012) investigated the effect of the proportionality assumption on the factor content (capital, labour, services, ...) of trade. The author compared the results of two different methods to compile the Asian MRIO table, one assuming proportional import shares, and another survey-based including bilateral details on trade. She foundinds the net bias introduced by the proportionality assumption to be small “only because the biases on exports and imports of factor services cancel each other out”. In their working paper Milberg and Winkler (2010) studied the error from the proportionality assumption on the estimate of the effect of offshoring on the German labour demand for 36 sectors. They estimated the effect of offshoring applying the same econometric model but with two distinct data sets: one based on the proportionality assumption and one with additional details on the use of German imports. They found a large difference in the regression coefficient estimates between the two versions, in many cases even with reversed signs. Feenstra and Jensen (2012) did a similar comparison for the estimates of material offshoring from US manufacturing. They calculated the shares of imported intermediate inputs of individual manufacturing sectors in two ways: (1) using firm-level data on imports and production and (2) applying the proportionality assumption. They found a moderate to high correlation between the offshoring shares calculated with the distinct methods (correlation coefficient of 0.68 and 0.87 if shares are value weighted). Recently, Jiang et al. (2020) compared the material footprints of China and Chinese provinces based on two approaches: one with the assumption of proportional provincial import shares, and one with the inclusion of detailed data on Chinese inter-provincial trade. They found that the Chinese national material footprint is not significantly influenced by the choice of methods. Across provinces, however, the authors found variations in the material footprints between the two methods in the range from − 9% to + 14%. For disaggregated materials the differences between both methods were even ranging between − 48% and + 34%. From the literature review we identify two major research gaps. First, all studies so far are region-specific, i.e. they only examine how the calculated impacts change when including bilateral trade details for one country/region. Second, all but one study investigate economic effects, with only Jiang et al. (2020) considering an environmental impact indicator. The effect of the proportionality assumption on other environmental indicators, such as carbon, land or water footprints, however, have not been investigated so far. Which is surprising given that environmental footprinting has been a major field of application of MRIOs in the last decades (Wiedmann 2009; Wiedmann et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017; Brizga et al. 2017). Against this background, we test how sensitive environmental footprint estimates are towards changes in the allocation of import flows not only for individual regions but for the entire world trade. Since we do not know the true import shares we randomise the allocation of import flows to different target sectors while keeping fixed the available information, namely (i) the total imports per country and product, and (ii) the total use of product import per target sector. The aim of our study is to quantify the maximum uncertainty introduced by the proportionality assumption. We focus on the four most commonly used types of environmental footprints (carbon, material, land, and water) on two levels (country and industry).",3

MNCs allow local subsidiaries with foreign equity to get access to advanced technologies and techniques. This process in turn makes the local subsidiaries more productive while using a reduced level of input, and thus a higher level of total factor productivity (TFP) than other fully domestically owned firms. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is believed to be the preferred means through which technology transfers, as it can internalize better technologies at minimum or no additional cost (Rugman and Caves 1983). The potential of FDI to initiate technology transfer to local firms through productivity spillovers may be derived from the semi-public nature of technology and the way it is disseminated between firms. These are all neo-classical thoughts about spillover effects regarding FDI. Theoretically, it is proven that host-country firms gain from the externalities associated with foreign investment through productivity improvement and international integration (Costa and de Queiroz 2002). However, empirically there is no consensus regarding the externalities generated by foreign firms. Theoretical works suggest various channels through which knowledge and technology are transferred to domestic firms. The complexities associated with unraveling diverse effects in practice as well as data limitations have prevented researchers from providing influential empirical evidence of externalities resulting from FDI. There are ample number of studies on FDI spillover. However, among empirical studies, comparative firm-level analyses across countries have received relatively limited focus. The main reason behind this limited focus is the lack of comparable firm-level data for a set of countries. This study examines the influence of FDI spillover effects on firm productivity in Bangladesh in comparison to Vietnam. Both countries are emerging economies in Asia. Their economic development and constant changes in improving their FDI policy frameworks have enabled these economies to become important destinations for investment. The fundamental strength of Bangladesh is its favorable geographic location, putting it closer to the two big markets—India and China. It has the potential to perform as an economic passageway between South and East Asia. Moreover, foreign companies are motivated to invest because of Bangladesh’s large home market with more than 170 million consumers, high economic growth, a fast-growing private sector, low production cost, available labor, etc. In addition, Bangladesh currently enjoys duty-free access to the EU and some other developed countries. As the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) comes into force, foreign investors will also enjoy duty-free access to India along with the EU and other developed countries. FDI is expected to amplify because of the current infrastructural development work of power plants, bridges, metro rails, elevated expressways and other projects. Compare to the current escalation of FDI flows and the potentiality of further inflow, the previous research works on FDI spillover effects in Bangladesh are inadequate. They are mostly time-series analyses and confined to FDI’s macro-impact on economic growth. This study attempts to fill the research gap on Bangladesh regarding the firm-level analysis of FDI spillovers and their effect on productivity. In addition, this paper aims to compare the effects of FDI spillovers on firm-level productivity of Bangladesh with that of Vietnam. Although currently positioned far ahead of Bangladesh in terms of attracting FDI, the historical trend for Vietnam (Fig. 1) reveals that before the 1990s, the country’s FDI inflow over GDP was in line with that of Bangladesh. From the early 1990s on, Vietnam experienced a surge of FDI inflows, while Bangladesh failed to attract foreign investors. In terms of per capita GDP (Fig. 2), Bangladesh was slightly higher compared to Vietnam until 2001. Currently, the per capita GDP of Vietnam is far better than that of Bangladesh.Footnote 1 It is interesting to study this scenario, in which, starting from similar specific economic conditions, one economy progressed over time, while another economy simply maintained its earlier position. Vietnam is a successful developing Southeast Asian nation that has adopted welcoming FDI as a part of its export-led development strategy. Historically, this region has a very good track record of attracting FDI. FDI inflows have significantly contributed to the strong economic growth and sustained development of this region. Ten Southeast Asian nations including Vietnam have formed a regional trade bloc named the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)Footnote 2 for the purpose of promoting governmental and economic cooperation and regional stability. Strong intra-ASEAN investments and robust investment from other Asian economies mainly contribute to the increasing trend of FDI flows in this region. Similarly, the robust increasing trend of FDI in Vietnam is contributed to mostly by ASEAN countries and other East Asian economic giants: China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no comparative study that specifically examines firm-level spillover effects for Bangladesh and Vietnam to date. This study examines the effect of FDI spillover transmission channels and compares their effects on the firm productivity of selected two countries. Commonly identified FDI spillover channels can be distinguished as intra-industrial and inter-industrial spillover. Intra-industrial and inter-industrial spillovers are commonly referred to as horizontal and vertical spillover (backward and forward), respectively.Footnote 3 According to theoretical expectation, the presence of foreign firms leads domestic firms in the same industry to experience productivity gain (horizontal spillover) through different channels, such as demonstration, competition, labor mobility, etc. First, the demonstration effect works through the copying of foreign firms’ advanced technology, production strategies and organizational skills by domestic firms, thereby improving their productivity (Das 1987; Wang and Blomstrom 1992). Second, competition refers to a situation in which domestic firms are forced to improve production efficiency as foreign rivals enter the domestic market. Market concentration may reduce via the process of competition, but the competition effect can also be negative. Fierce competition with foreign firms sometimes forces several domestic firms to exit the market, as they can no longer compete at all (Wang and Blomström, 1992; Glass and Saggi, 2002). Aitken and Harrison (1999) also term such an effect the “market stealing effect”, stating that foreign firms actually switch demand from the domestic firms. Third, the migration of skilled and trained employees from foreign firms to domestic firms may result in positive knowledge spillover. Potential technological know-how and managerial skills spread to domestic firms. On the other hand, comparatively high salaries persuade skilled employees to switch from domestic firms to foreign firms, and thus, create productivity losses (Fosfuri et al., 2001; Glass and Saggi, 2002). Foreign firms usually prevent employee turnover by paying higher wages, as well. Many recent studies do not find robust empirical evidence of productivity benefits through horizontal or intra-industry spillovers to domestic firms. Javorcik (2004), Bwalya (2006), Barrios et al. (2004), Blalock and Gertler (2008), Damijan et al. (2008), and Kugler (2006) do not find evidence of horizontal FDI spillovers. Inter-industry, or vertical, spillover mainly results from the upstream–downstream business relationship between foreign firms and domestic firms. The vertical spillover mechanism works through backward and forward linkages. Backward spillover takes place when a domestic firm in an upstream sector experiences productivity gains through the process of supplying inputs to a downstream sector’s foreign-owned firms. This can happen as foreign firms deliberately transfer knowledge to domestic input suppliers. To achieve better input supply, foreign-owned firms provide technological assistance as well as training for employees of host-country supplier firms (Lall, 1978). High demands for locally produced intermediates and increased completion for foreign customers persuade domestic suppliers to improve their product quality and efficiency (Javorcik 2004). Forward linkages are not given much attention in the literature. Spillovers through forward linkages may occur from upstream foreign-invested suppliers of inputs supplying downstream domestic firms. A domestic firm can learn from its supplier (a foreign-invested firm), which is embodied in advanced technologies (Grossman and Helpman 1993). Increase in foreign investment in upstream industry boosts competition and forces other suppliers of the same industry to improve their production efficiency in order to survive in business. As a consequence, downstream domestic firms might experience productivity improvements due to more efficiently produced inputs by all upstream firms (Newman et al. 2015). Researchers are now more interested in searching for the possibility of FDI spillover across industries. Schoors and van der Tol (2002) for Hungary, Javorick (2004) for Lithuania, and Blalock (2002) for Indonesia all find positive spillover effects through backward and forward linkages. Similarly, Merlevede and Schoors (2005) find evidence of positive forward spillovers, but found backward spillover only in the case of the export-oriented sectors of Romanian firms. Several studies focus on more than one economy. Konings (2001) and Barrios et al. (2004) find contrasting results on different European countries’ economies. While Konings (2001) finds negative FDI spillover effects on local firms in Bulgaria and Romania and no effect on Polish firms, Barrios et al. (2004) found positive spillover effects on firms in Spain and Ireland. Using the World Bank’s firm-level survey data for five transitional economies (Poland, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic) Yasar and Morrison (2007) find positive intra-industry spillover effects from foreign presence in domestic industries. Tondl and Forneo (2010) and Muhlen (2013) study spillover effects on Latin American economies. Tondl and Forneo (2010) find evidence for positive horizontal spillovers, whereas Muhlen (2013) finds negative spillover effects from foreign presence within industries. This study utilizes firm-level panel data to estimate productivity spillover effects from FDI. Comparable Bangladeshi and Vietnamese firm-level data for different years is taken from the Enterprise Surveys provided by the World Bank. The findings of this study suggest the channels through which domestic firms gain productivity by the presence of foreign firms differ between the two countries. Our empirical findings support the presence of an intra-industry FDI spillover effect in Bangladeshi firms, while among Vietnamese firms, there is evidence of productivity spillovers through inter-industry backward linkages. Spillover through backward linkages can be explained as the firms’ productivity being positively associated with the degree of potential contacts with foreign customers of the downstream sector. The next section of the paper discusses FDI positions and prospects in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Section 3 explains the dynamics of our dataset and its sources. Section 4 deals with the empirical framework and estimation issues of different spillover variables. Section 5 reports the empirical findings and discusses the results. This paper concludes with a brief summary of the findings in Sect. 6.",4

In a single country input–output framework with N industries, the result may record the decomposed changes for each industry \(i \in \{1, \dots , N\}\), as in the classic contribution of Dietzenbacher and Los (1998). The underlying changes in factors usually describe economy-wide changes, covering all N industries, and the result implicitly aggregates the effects of each industry \(j \in \{1, \dots , N\}\) or groups thereof. Disaggregation of factors into components that are industry-specific significantly increases the number of factors in the decomposition and, therefore, the complexity of computations. This also means that one of the factors is an inverse—typically, Leontief inverse—of a sum of other, industry-specific factors. The complexity of structural decomposition where the target variable is a product of a large number of factors was addressed by Dietzenbacher and Los (1998) who reviewed various simplified ad hoc solutions. Since then, many authors have adopted the average of the two ‘polar decompositions’ as their default SDA strategy, though de Haan (2001) indicated that these ‘polar decompositions’ were not unique, and there was no reason why a particular pair of ‘polar decompositions’ should be preferred. This is even more obvious if an inverse matrix is a sum of factors where their order can be freely altered. The problem of additive factors nested within the Leontief inverse is the biggest complication in SDA. Because of matrix inversion this problem is unknown in index number analysis, and decompositions that are consistent with the index number theory (surveyed by Wang et al 2017; de Boer and Rodrigues 2020) may be infeasible. A ‘textbook’ solution, discussed by Rose and Casler (1996), uses a factorisation of the change in Leontief inverse. Whether this solution biases the result and whether there is another ad hoc solution that minimises the bias—has not been systematically explored. Bridging this gap in the literature, this paper reviews the ad hoc solutions that simplify the SDA calculations and approximate the results of complete decompositions. There are four solutions, called here ‘shortcuts’, for the additive SDA and two for the multiplicative SDA. The author runs numerical tests of all ‘shortcuts’ using the time series of input–output data from Statistics Denmark and Statistics Netherlands. The number of factors within the Leontief inverse varies from 5 to 8. The tests reveal that one of the ‘shortcuts’ performs consistently better than others. This ‘shortcut’—the average of the two ‘polar decomposition forms’—is not new, but remained largely unnoticed, though reported to be efficient by Dietzenbacher and Los (1998). Indeed, it makes the SDA ‘short’: instead of computing \(2^{N-1}\) decomposition forms and taking their weighted average for each of \(N\) factors to obtain the true result, it only requires computing 2 decomposition forms and taking their simple average to obtain an approximate result. Furthermore, a pair of ‘polar decomposition forms’ is unique to each factor and does not require the researcher to guess which of the forms should be preferred. The contribution of this paper is the evidence of the best-performing approximate solution in a special case of SDA where the exact and true solution becomes prohibitively complex. The design of the numerical experiment that yields that evidence stands out for a larger data input and number of factors than in many previous surveys of SDA techniques. The special case addressed here may become a typical case in SDA of inter-country input–output tables where a factor may describe, e.g., a change in trade relationship between two countries, rather than the change in global trade pattern. In the language of econometric modelling, SDA is designed to construct a ‘counterfactual’ to answer the question “how the target variable would have changed if only one factor changed and other remained the same?” With country- and industry-specific factors, this ‘counterfactual’ can be constructed at a very disaggregate level. Then the direct calculation of a disaggregate effect by SDA may be an appealing alternative to the indirect estimation of an aggregate effect by means of statistical inference followed by a possible disaggregation. This is true in cases where both SDA and econometric solutions apply, with due account of their conceptual differences, for example, in cases where the target and explanatory variables are connected via global value chains. The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 reminds the reader of the classic solutions to the additive and multiplicative SDA that are consistent with the index number theory, briefly reviews generic approaches to reduce the intensity of SDA calculations and to obtain reasonable approximations. Following is an exposition of a particular case where one of the factors in the decomposition is an inverse of a sum of other factors, or, more precisely, the Leontief inverse. Then the ad hoc solutions, or ‘shortcuts’ to the complete decomposition, are formulated. Section 3 explains how these ‘shortcuts’ are tested and evaluated and how the necessary data are selected and prepared. This section concludes by reporting and discussing the results of the numerical experiment. Final remarks are set out in Sect. 4.",3

D. Hewings,Ahmad Alawadhi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Small national economies, such as Kuwait, share many similarities with large regional economies with the exception of having a separate currency and the ability to control fiscal policy. In Kuwait’s case, the currency closely follows the US dollar, although it is pegged to a basket of undisclosed currencies. The country’s exports are dominated by oil and oil-related products (Wood and Alsayegh 2014). This paper briefly describes the way a set of supply and use tables are used to construct several alternative input–output tables. These are then used to explore policy options for the country to diversify away from public sector dominance and move to greater dependence upon private-sector production. Given Kuwait’s size and location, the economy has many of the characteristics of a regional economy in the context of Middle Eastern countries that share a strong dependence on the public sector as well as oil-related production activities. A series of analyses on interconnectedness in the Kuwaiti economy was undertaken. The analysis started by describing the structure of the Kuwaiti economy, applying direct backward and forward linkage analysis. Leontief multipliers were computed and public–private interdependences were examined using sectoral output multipliers, backward and forward linkage analysis. The remaining part of the paper is divided into five sections. Section 2  is devoted to background discussion covering the policy context, the structure of the Kuwaiti economy and broader development strategies. Section 3 is devoted to methodological discussions, encompassing theoretical analysis and description of the Kuwaiti input–output table. Section 4 presents results and provides summary discussion. The paper ends with concluding remarks in Sect. 5.",

Solow’s (1956) growth model highlights that the growth rate of per capita output, capital and consumption is given by the exogenous technological change. However, within that framework, the total factor productivity (TFP) is calculated as a residual, somewhat unsettling. Since then, several authors have worked on what became known as growth accounting [see, e.g., Hulten (2010) and Jorgeson et al. (1987)]. Notwithstanding the considerable literature that followed Solow’s (1957) first attempt to measure TFP, they underestimate the contribution of intermediate inputs insofar as they are not explicitly considered. In the present work, we fill this gap, paying particular attention to intermediate inputs’ role in analysing the Brazilian economy’s productivity growth from 2000 to 2014. Intermediate inputs have a unique role in spreading productivity growth [see, e.g., Aulin-Ahmavaara (1999)]. According to Jones (2011), they provide linksFootnote 1 that create a multiplier insofar as an industry may benefit from increased productivity in other industries from which it acquires inputs, which also generates impacts for aggregate productivity. The author proposes that linkages are a crucial part of the explanation by delivering a noteworthy example: “Low productivity in electric power generation - for example, because of theft, inferior technology, or misallocation - makes electricity more costly, which reduces output in banking and construction. But this in turn makes it harder to finance and build new dams and therefore further hinders electric power generation.” Jones (2011, p. 1-2) To provide a more in-depth analysis of the behaviour of both sectoral and aggregate Brazilian productivity and economic growth between 2000 and 2014, we use here the MFP (Multifactor Productivity) with Domar aggregation. With this approach, we overcome the MFP shortcoming of treating each industry in isolation, not capturing the productivity transfer between them [see, e.g., De Juan and Eladio (2000)]. To the best of our knowledge, although some authorsFootnote 2 focus on sectoral and aggregate productivity growth concerning Brazil, this is the first paper that adopts the above-mentioned strategy for the Brazilian economy. One of our aims is precisely to overcome the MFP limitation using the Domar method insofar as it explicitly considers that technical advancement occurs at the industry level. This method’s advantage is that it can capture the productivity growth contributions of individual industries and those gains that accrue from the linkages among them.Footnote 3 Considering the effect of transferring productivity between industries in the MFP approach allows us to treat industries within an interdependent and interconnected system via intermediate capital goods. Besides, a noteworthy characteristic of Domar aggregation is that it is not a weighted average but a weighted sum of industrial productivity growth, with the sum of its weights higher than unity in input–output economies. The added Domar weights then measure the interconnection and linkages potential between sectors, which we call density, capable of propagating productivity growth throughout the economy. After Domar (1961), several authors improved the method theoreticallyFootnote 4 and used it empiricallyFootnote 5 to perform growth accounting. Some essential theoretical works are Hulten (1978) which related the Domar aggregation with a macroproduction possibility frontier. Jorgeson et al. (1987) is a seminal work about using it with several theoretical improvements, while Aulin-Ahmavaara (1999) formulated explicitly the output price reductions caused by the productivity in downstream sectors. More recently, Ten Raa and Shestalova (2011) and Balk (2020) also have delivered essential contributions.Footnote 6 Given the usefulness of Domar aggregation, particular research fields have used it as a tool to calculate and decompose productivity growth. It has been useful, for instance, to study the implications of the Baumol Cost Disease within input–output frameworks [e.g., Oulton (2001), Sasaki (2007), Baumol (1967), Hartwig and Krämer (2019) and Sasaki (2020)]. It has also been adopted to study production networks and shock propagation channels as a mechanism for transforming microeconomic shocks into macroeconomic fluctuations [e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2012), Carvalho (2014), Carvalho and Salehi (2019) and Baqaee and Farhi (2019)]. Another useful methodology of calculating productivity growth that captures the role of interconnectedness among industries and ultimately the economic system as a whole is the vertical integration approach [e.g., De Juan and Eladio (2000), Gaberllini and Wirkierman (2009,2014) and Lind (2020)]. An essential difference between the two methods is that they follow different ways of organising the economic system. While the Domar aggregation deals with the economy in a traditional input–output industrial setup, the second method measures productivity from a vertically integrated perspective, in which each sector is characterised by a composition of industries needed to produce every final commodity in the economy [Cas and Rymes (1991)]. An additional relevant difference between Domar aggregation and the vertical integration approach is that while the former aggregates industrial MFP, the latter calculates the total usage of labour per final output, both directly and indirectly. Authors, such as Cas and Rymes (1991) and Aulin-Ahmavaara (1999), though using distinct assumptions, have formally demonstrated that, in the aggregate, the measurements arising from the productivity of vertically integrated sectors and Domar aggregation tend to coincide and are closer the higher the level of aggregation. Our main aim in the present paper is to structurally analyse the Brazilian economy’s productivity behaviour using this method to highlight interdependence and interconnection between industries. We aim to focus on the productivity gains (or losses) that spread amongst industries via circulating capital due to increased productivity and lower (or higher) costs. Using the Domar aggregation to decompose Brazil’s overall productivity growth for three macrosectors, we confirmed some results [e.g., Souza and da Cunha (2018)] and found new ones. We verified that services and primary industries macrosectors positively impacted average productivity growth, although the macromanufacturing sector contributed to negative productivity growth. But we also went a step further in focusing on the multiplicative effect of propagating productivity growth due to Domar weights. We conclude that manufacturing had a higher sectoral density than its value-added share, albeit it seems to have spread negative productivity growth in most of the given period. These findings reassert the importance of the industrial sector as one of the main drivers of growth. Had this sector presented a better performance during the time under consideration, the Brazilian economy’s overall productivity growth would be better both by the direct and indirect channels. We organise this paper as follows: besides this brief introduction, in the next section, we present an outlook of the Brazilian economy. Section 3 is the methodological section, with both an explanation of the database and a theoretical review of Domar aggregation and its usage. In the fourth section, we use this method empirically for delivering the main results of our analysis, which considers 48, 10 and 3 sector levels of aggregation. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",

Flegg,Guiseppe R. Lamonica,Timo Tohmo,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Many non-survey methods of regionalizing a national input–output table (NIOT) have been developed, with the aim of avoiding the high costs and lengthy delays associated with constructing regional tables via survey-based methods. Non-survey methods include those based on location quotients (LQs) and constrained matrix-balancing methods. The LQ-based methods include the classical simple and cross-industry LQs, along with several refinements examined in the next section. These methods hinge on the assumption that regions and nations employ the same technology of production, with the implication that regional input coefficients differ from their national counterparts only so far as each region imports goods and services from other regions. The performance of LQ-based methods deteriorates significantly when this assumption of a common technology is violated. By contrast, constrained matrix-balancing methods are less sensitive to violations of the assumption of identical technology. These procedures estimate unknown data from limited initial information, subject to a set of linear constraints. The most popular of such techniques are RAS (Bacharach 1970; Stone 1961) and the cross-entropy (CE) method (Golan et al. 1994), both of which are known to work well (Davis et al. 1977; Golan and Vogel 2000; Hosoe 2014; Kapur and Kesavan 1992; Lamonica et al. 2020; Léony et al. 1999; Robinson et al. 2001; Vazquez et al. 2015). The constrained matrix-balancing procedures include methods based on minimizing squared or absolute differences (Pavia et al. 2009). However, such techniques are more time-consuming to implement than the pure LQ-based methods and normally require the solution of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, whereas the LQ-based methods are very quick and simple to apply. The present study focuses on the FLQ (Flegg’s LQ), which is often found to be one of the most accurate pure LQ-based methods (Bonfiglio and Chelli 2008; Flegg and Tohmo 2016). Applications of the FLQ include Dávila-Flores (2015), Hermannsson (2016), Jahn (2017), Kronenberg and Fuchs (2021), Morrissey (2016), and Singh and Singh (2011). To apply the FLQ, a value for a crucial unknown parameter, δ, must be chosen. Although several empirical studies have sought to find appropriate values of δ, these studies have not been conclusive. Examples include analyses of data for Scotland (Flegg and Webber 2000), Germany (Kowalewksi 2015), Argentina (Flegg et al. 2016) and South Korea (Flegg and Tohmo 2019). Given these diverse outcomes, Jahn et al. (2020) recommend that analysts should consider regional characteristics when selecting a value of δ in the interval 0.3 ± 0.1. This range, which is suggested by earlier empirical work, can then be refined in the light of the results. Jahn et al. also formulate an econometric model that should assist in this process. Nevertheless, it is evident that the choice of a suitable value of δ is still an open question, which has limited the practical use of the FLQ. Our aim is, therefore, to propose a strategy to estimate the value of δ in such a way as to optimize the regionalization of the NIOT. This strategy combines constrained matrix-balancing procedures with the FLQ. The expectation is that this hybrid approach should yield better results than would be attainable by applying each approach alone. Of the possible matrix-balancing procedures, the CE method was chosen rather than RAS for several reasons. In particular, the standard RAS method can only handle non-negative matrices, which would limit the application proposed in this paper. Although its generalization GRAS (Junius and Oosterhaven 2003) enables matrices with negative elements to be updated, its objective function has been questioned by Lemelin (2009), Huang et al. (2008) and Temurshoev et al. (2013). Moreover, the results obtained by Golan et al. (1994) and Robinson et al. (2001) appear to favour the CE method, while Lamonica et al. (2020) demonstrate that this method performs well when it is applied to real data, especially for small economies. Indeed, we find that the modified CE (MCE) method, as implemented in this study, outperforms GRAS. The proposed procedure involves three steps. The first applies the MCE method to regionalize the NIOT. This is designed to account for negative or zero input coefficients. The second step uses the derived regional matrix, along with the national table, to estimate the optimal δ for each region via a simple regression model. In the third step, this estimated δ is used to apply the FLQ formula, thereby computing the final estimates of the regional input coefficients. It is worth noting that this hybrid approach can easily be adapted to enhance the performance of other pure LQ-based methods that depend on one or more unknown parameters. Our approach is tested on the South Korean interregional input–output table (KIRIOT) for the year 2005. It was built by the Bank of Korea for all 16 South Korean regions, with a classification of 78 economic sectors. A smaller version with 28 economic sectors is also available, but we opted to use the larger version, so as to minimize aggregation bias. The KRIOT is one of the very few survey-based full interregional I–O tables. It has data on the volume of all intersectoral transactions, both within and across regions, so it is ideal for our purposes. Indeed, Zhao and Choi (2015, p. 909) remark: [In 2009, the Bank of Korea] divided the entire country into 16 regions and issued regional Leontief inverse tables and type I output multipliers for each of these regions. These data can be considered as benchmark tables since they are entirely based on surveys. Since the KIRIOT contains negative and null flows, the MCE method is employed. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the enhanced version of the FLQ approach developed here outperforms the MCE method, when it is applied separately, and has a similar performance to the ‘optimal’ FLQ approach, where δ is selected by using the observed regional coefficient matrix. Of course, in reality, such a matrix would seldom be available to regional analysts; its use here is merely to generate optimal values of δ that can be used as a benchmark in our analysis. Our aim is to offer a new way of regionalizing a NIOT in situations where an analyst has access only to the total output of each regional sector. Where such data are unavailable, sectoral employment could be used as a proxy. This proposed hybrid method, hereafter referred to as the FLQ+ method, is an improvement on the present state of the art, in which analysts need to select values of δ on the basis of a priori considerations, e.g. values found in earlier studies, or by taking regional characteristics into account, as is suggested by Jahn et al. (2020). In order to demonstrate the practical advantages of using the FLQ+ method, we compare its performance with the results from the MCE method, GRAS and the FLQ with a single assumed value of δ for every region.",9

The United Kingdom (UK) has left the EU on January 31, 2020. However, the UK had still unlimited access to the Single Market until December 31, 2020. For most of the time during the year 2020, it has not been clear whether Brexit will lead to tariffs on trade between the UK and the remaining EU (EU-27). Without the last-minute agreement between the EU and the UK of December 24, 2020 (Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA), exports from the remaining EU member countries to the UK would have become subject to tariffs according to World Trade Organization standards (WTO-Scenario) as of January 1, 2021. We analyze the regional employment effects of tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers. In general, tariffs reduce international trade and result in more unemployment (Furceri et al. 2018) and increase prices for consumers (Amiti et al. 2019). However, sign and magnitude of the effect can depend on the nature and the persistence of the trade shock. In this paper, we add to the literature on employment effects of trade shocks by studying the employment effects in more than 40 countries (both EU member states and other countries) due to increasing trade costs in case of a Brexit, where there is no agreement in place for trade between the UK and the EU (WTO-Scenario). In particular, we show how the regional distribution of the effects within the EU can be estimated using regional sectoral employment data. The UK is an important trading partner for EU-27 countries. After the U.S., the UK has been the second largest destination outside the EU of goods and services exports from EU-27 countries in 2020 accounting for about 14% of total EU-27 exports.Footnote 1 A degradation of the trading framework between EU-27 and UK may have important economic consequences on production and employment in EU-27 countries and regions. Because product groups are not all affected in the same way and because of regional agglomeration of production, regions within the EU-27 will face heterogeneous consequences from Brexit. It is important to understand this heterogeneity to develop appropriate policy responses. If the negotiations between the EU and the UK had failed, a no-deal Brexit would have implied that exports from the remaining EU member countries to the UK would be subject to tariffs. Even without formal tariffs, there are non-tariff trade costs, which consist of organizational cost (waiting, e.g.) at the borders and of substantial paperwork for the producers to document that rules of origin are complied to. Accordingly, the British demand for EU products is likely to decrease due to these trade costs. We study the international potential employment effects of the decline in British import demand. To quantify these effects we take into account that production of final goods depends on intermediate inputs. Not only firms that directly export goods or services to UK are affected by Brexit but also firms that deliver intermediate inputs to these firms. Similar to studies which assess the impact of Brexit on production on the national level, we use input–output analysis in a first stage to quantify the countries and industries that are most affected by a decline in UK import demand from EU-27 due to a no-deal Brexit. Assuming that existing production structures and final goods prices need time to adapt to the changing trade framework between UK and EU-27, input–output analysis can be informative about potential short-term effects due to the decline in UK import demand from EU-27 and thereby complement results from general-equilibrium models which in general are more informative about the long-run. British firms are also affected themselves due to their participation in global value chains. The results that we report for the UK only refer to the effects of less intermediate input production for foreign firms that export to the UK. It should be stressed that the results that we present are partial effects of a negative trade shock. We do not consider macroeconomic general equilibrium effects. We do not aim to estimate the total effects of Brexit on employment in the UK or in any other country. Trade diversion is also not considered. Moreover, it is not only international trade in goods and services that will be affected by Brexit.Footnote 2 Overall, our results are more informative for the EU-27 countries than for the UK, because the aspects that are not covered here are much more important for the UK than for the EU-27 countries. We use the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) to document (i) which industries, (ii) in which countries will be affected most by a decline of British imports from EU member countries and (iii) what the according regional and sectoral employment effects will be. For the EU, we provide a regional breakdown on the NUTS-2 level; for Germany, we additionally provide a detailed regional breakdown on the NUTS-3 (county) level. Chen et al. (2018) also provide a regional breakdown of Brexit exposure on the NUTS-2 level; however, they do not look at employment but only at GDP and labour income, which can be directly inferred from the World Input–Output Database. Our contribution is to combine WIOD with regional and sectoral employment data. The paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the data and our methodology in Sect. 2. Then, we explain the results by country, by industry and by region in Sect. 3. Finally, we provide conclusions in Sect. 4.",

In the form that has become more popular and was developed first by Stone’s research team in Cambridge, the SAM is the basis of modern national accounting and records transactions across activities, production factors, and the main institutional agents that constitute a modern market economy, namely households, enterprises, government, the financial and the international trade sector. As for the input–output, but in more integrated and value-based fashion, a SAM collects data on inflows and outflows of services by recording receipts and payments using the double accounting principle in a mutually consistent form. By convention, each column of a SAM thus records payments from that account to each other account, while each row records receipts to a specific account from each other account, with total receipts being equal to total expenditures. For this reason, the columns reporting production activities outlays can be interpreted as production processes, whose costs, including factor payments, equal in aggregate the value of production. At the same time, the corresponding rows can be interpreted as the revenues of each activity from all other activities. The SAM records value added formation by accounting for payments from activities to primary production factors (capital and labor) and to the government in the form of indirect taxation. The SAM also accounts for income formation by recording payments from factors of production (value added) to households, government and other institutions, including the financial and the foreign sector, and by accounting for other transactions, including direct taxes, subsidies, interest payments and various types of transfers across institutions. The SAM concept and practice is at the base of the UN national account system (SNA), and in more recent years it has been extended to include environmental flows, such as carbon emissions and ecosystem services of various sort (Burthoo-Barah et al. 2019; Scandizzo and Cufari 2019; Scandizzo and Ferrarese 2015). While the SAM has been often utilized to evaluate the indirect effects of capital expenditures from investment projects as a demand shock (Scandizzo and Ferrarese 2015; Debowicz et al. 2013), its use to assess the impact of the investment beyond the activation effects of the construction period, has been limited. The theory and practice of project evaluation has also typically neglected the fact that, while in the construction period a project may be considered as part of the capital formation account, after the construction period, the project is generally a production activity, which is linked to sectors, factors and institutions by a series of transactions that can be accounted for, using the same principles, industrial classification and balancing of all other activities represented in the SAM. For example, the increased demand generated by public investment in a new road during the construction period can be measured as a vector of purchases of capital goods, in analogy and as an implicit part of the investment (capital formation) vector in the SAM. Once completed, however, the road becomes a service producing activity that not only generates increased demand for inputs, but also contributes to revenue formation, increase consumer surpluses and spill over the economy thereby increasing economic activity in the rest of the economy. An investment project, in particular, is characterized by a cash flow, for each year or project life, that can be split into a series of costs and a series of revenues and, as such, conveniently represented in a specific column and row of a SAM. This representation not only provides a convenient way to represent a project in a SAM, but also suggests that SAM production activities can be seen as sets of investment projects at various stages of implementation and are thus subject to variations over time due to the overlapping of projects of different generations. In turn, this twofold consideration on the role of projects as activities and of the activities as overlapping ongoing projects, indicates that a proper SAM accounting should not only aim at accounting for direct responses to final demand changes, but also for the variation of the patterns of transactions (i.e., changes in the SAM coefficients) due to new projects and technologies. Following Stone’s original interpretation (Stone 1952), SAM accounts and coefficients can be considered special cases, respectively, of a transaction and a response matrix for an economy. The response matrix can be more or less complex and may coincide with a linear approximation of a full-fledged computable general equilibrium model (Perali and Scandizzo 2018). In the case of an investment project, therefore, while the project cash flow can be directly incorporated in a transaction SAM, its translation into a column and row vector of coefficients require a series of assumptions on the technology and the behavior of the economic agents involved. In the simplest case, the response matrix is a matrix of input output coefficients for the production activities, and of expenditure shares for the behavior of the institutions (households, government, etc.). In the case of a CGE model, the project transaction column contains, for each period of project life, the project payments to the factors of production (including the project net revenues to capital), as well as to activities and institutions. The response (coefficient) column instead in the simplest case embeds the hypothesis that project outlays are fixed proportions of its total cost. Similarly, the project transaction row contains the revenues and possibly the external effects paid to the project by production activities, institutions and the financial sector. For these stakeholders the payments made to project represent costs for goods or services provided by the project, so that in the response matrix, they are converted into coefficients, which in the simplest case are fixed proportions of total costs of their own production. As required for all SAM accounts, project rows and columns of the transaction matrix balance, since the project outlays, which include the net project revenues paid to capital, equal the project inflows or gross revenues with any financial gap filled by the capital formation (i.e., the financing) sector. For example, in the construction period, the outlays will consist of the construction costs, while the balancing inflows will be provided by payments from the capital formation accounts. More generally, the rows and columns of the SAM as a transaction matrix can be reinterpreted as the twin entries of the cash flow account of an economy for a given period of time. For the production sectors, this means that revenues from product sales are recorded in the row entries and costs in the column entries. The difference between revenues and intermediate costs is value added. This can be considered a result of the production activity (the larger the better, ceteris paribus) and is the basis to compute all welfare measures including GDP. In turn, value added is recorded as a row entry in the accounts of factors of production. Here row entries represent incomes from employment while column entries document payments to factor owners, which in a market economy are households, firms and the government. For institutions, finally, row entries represent incomes from factor ownership, interests and dividends, or transfers of various kind, while column entries are expenditures for goods and services and savings (as purchases of financial assets). Rather than value added, however, the return to capital in the form of gross margins of production are recorded as the difference between sector revenues and sector costs (including cost of intermediates and cost of labor) and are credited to the account of capital as a factor of production. In sum, while the general practice in input output and SAM-based model has been to consider an investment project as a vector of expenditure shocks, the proper way to analyze it is as a special form of an activity, with its own input output parameters that evolve over time. This type of activity is characterized by a series of cash flows that change over time. At any point in time an investment project can thus be represented in the SAM as a column of cash outflows, including all capital and maintenance costs from intermediates and resulting value added, and as a row of cash inflows, including financing from the government and private savings during the construction phase, and revenues from increased production of goods and services during the operational phase. Since costs and revenues have to balance, financing from the capital formation sector, or directly from the government or other project sponsors must be recorded as one or more row entries in the years where cash outflows are larger than cash inflows (the “construction” period). Vice versa, once the project is operational and inflows become larger than outflows, returns can be credited to capital (as gross business margins) or institutions (government or households). The benefits from the project, however, are not limited to the remuneration of capital, since other social benefits and costs may also be considered in the economic analysis.",

This reassessment was important because the 2008 crisis was different than previous ones; it was global, more severe and incurred at least one more crisis, that of debt sustainability and sovereign default (Romer 2012). In Europe, five countries initially (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) and then Cyprus faced severe problems with their sovereign debt and were forced to apply consolidation measures in order to restrain their deficits and lower their debt-to-GDP ratio at sustainable levels. For the rescue of the countries mentioned above, except Italy and Spain, consolidation programs were formed by the ESM, ECB and the IMF. Consequently, research was focused on the debt-to-GDP ratio dynamics and its relation with other variables (such as interest rates, primary surpluses and GDP growth rate) in order to be investigated whether the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain at sustainable levels or not. Escolano (2010), Genberg and Sulstarova (2008), Casadio et al. (2012) and Berti et al. (2013) are examples of research on debt-to-GDP ratio dynamics. However, despite the research on the interaction of the above variables with the debt-to-GDP ratio, there are not to our knowledge any research that explicitly combines the debt evolution with national income dynamics and examines them as a system, employing the framework we use.Footnote 1 Before 2008Footnote 2 fiscal policy was abandoned for several reasons, being among them the following three: fiscal policy can stimulate national income only after some lags; if monetary policy can achieve the smallest output gap then fiscal policy is not needed any more; third, Ricardian equivalence had set in question its efficacy. However, the crisis put forth again its importance as policy instrument to overcome a recession. Romer (2012) stresses that fiscal policy has great effects even in the short-run. Blanchard et al. (2010) points that, having no other means for expansionary policy, given the zero lower bound of policy rate, fiscal space is vital and improved fiscal policy methods, such as fiscal stabilizers, must be built on. Another aspect of the debt crisis was that it created an intellectual dispute about whether the needed austerity should be front or back loaded and, even more, if austerity is contractionary or expansionary. The first part of this dispute sets the question: should a highly indebted country conduct contractionary policy to limit the budget deficits or expansionary policy, together with commitment for future fiscal discipline, to overcome the recession? The front-loaded austerity is needed to avoid sovereign default but deepens the recession. The back-loaded austerity helps to overcome the recession, but increases the debt-to-GDP ratio. Berti et al. (2013) support the front-loaded austerity, as they stress that even though in the short-run debt-to-GDP ratio rises, in the long-run it returns to sustainable levels, while Romer (2012) supports the back-loaded austerity, as the commitment for future fiscal discipline is enough to calm financial markets. Regarding the second part of this dispute, Alesina and Ardagna (2010), Alesina et al. (2018) and Alesina et al. (2019) supports that austerity based on spending cuts is less likely to create a recession than that based on tax increases. They even document a few episodes of expansionary fiscal adjustments, such as that of Ireland, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden in the 1980s and Canada in the 1990s. On the other hand, Romer (2011) disagrees and supports that expansionary and contractionary fiscal measures has great effects and these effects are to the expected direction. In fact, this aspect of the dispute reveals the debate about the efficacy of the two fiscal policy instruments, spending and taxes, and which one to utilize. Romer (2011) supports that spending is always more effective than taxes, despite applying expansionary or contractionary measures. On the other hand, Alesina and Ardagna (2010) support that taxes are more effective than spending. Our study adds to the existing literature because it (a) stresses the importance of fiscal policy; (b) proves the necessity of the simultaneous usage of both taxes and government outlays; (c) vanishes the dilemma of front-loaded or back-loaded austerity; (d) introduces the notion of second relation, namely the deceleration of private investments due to sovereign debt, and (e) explicitly and discretely examines the national income and debt dynamics in order to provide answers regarding the fiscal consolidation of a country.",1

There are many useful associated multisectoral models to quantify impacts (economic, environmental, etc.) in territories with IO survey frameworks, usually regions, countries, and supranational unions. Yet its applicability becomes complicated when implemented at a sub-territorial level, particularly smaller regions and areas (e.g., counties), which have no accounting frameworks for elevated costs and even lack basic information to execute robust projects. Even so, nonsurvey techniques remain in use to generate sub-territorial tables based on the analytical capacity of the characteristic IO sector breakdown. In general, economic accounts available for a given territory will serve as a reference. The available sub-territorial data (resulting from disaggregation) refer to certain basic magnitudes (industry production, employment, or gross added value) and match the same year with the corresponding sectoral breakdown. Data from a higher territorial level are thus commonly used to generate an IO table at local, regional and even national levels. Though different methods exist (Morrison and Smith 1974; Schaffer and Chu 1969; Bonfiglio and Chelli 2008), Location Quotients (LQs) are the most widely used methods, especially Flegg’s Location Quotient (FLQ) or a modified version thereof, i.e., augmented FLQ (AFLQ). Different studies have held that LQs constitute an advance in generating IO tables (Flegg and Webber 1997, 2000; Flegg et al. 1995). Therefore, it is essential to select the LQ version to use, either alone or supplemented by adjustment techniques (Lamonica et al. 2020). Though there is no clear majority on which LQ version yields the best results, some studies (Bonfiglio and Chelli 2008; Jahn et al. 2020) show the prevalence of FLQ and AFLQ, while others (Zhao and Choi 2015; Lamonica and Chelli 2018) take an opposing view to favor other ratios. FLQ and AFLQ techniques have a parameter associated with the size of a certain magnitude of the sub-territory that should be delimited within an interval. The optimum parameter per se varies from one sub-territory to another, though multiple research papers undertake this quest for the optimum value (Kowalewksi 2015; Flegg and Tohmo 2016; Lamonica and Chelli 2018). This unknown value becomes problematic, as its calculation is thus arduous (Lampiris et al. 2019), probably because it is relatively sensitive due to the design of the corresponding formulas. Recently and in a context of identical available information, Pereira-López et al. (2020) rendered a two-dimensional reformulation of LQs (for domestic flow tables, though extrapolated to total flows with certain nuances), thus employing two parameters. However, these parameters are not associated with the size of the sub-territories but rather with the degree of specialization of the various branches of activity and sector size (by rows and columns, respectively). Their sensitivity will thus differ for FLQ and AFLQ parameters. In short, the process of generating sub-territorial IO tables has not yet been clearly defined. Researchers are avidly searching for the most suitable LQ and parameters capable of yielding robust results. This paper mainly seeks to look at LQ performance and, in particular, uncover the most effective way to ascertain the standard parameters used in their formulation, especially regarding 2D-LQ. The present introduction (Sect. 1) is followed by an LQ overview (methods) in Sect. 2. Section 3 describes the data used and Sect. 4 (results) contains an analysis of traditional LQs and the 2D-LQ method. Finally, Sect. 5 compares the four examined LQs, identifies guiding parameters for 2D-LQ and indicates the main conclusions drawn.",5

Previously, industrial development proceeded in a certain order, for instance, from import to domestic production and then to the export of manufactured goods, as illustrated by the fundamental “flying geese” pattern of development (Akamatsu 1962). Simultaneously, sequences of structural transformation occur in industries, such as upgrading from (i) consumer to intermediate and capital goods and (ii) technologically simple products to complex and sophisticated ones. However, this sequence of industrial development has become vague because of the expansion of GVCs. Indeed, a developing country can ascend into GVCs for sophisticated products, including high-tech products, by specializing in a niche segment of the value chain and becoming an exporter of these products. This phenomenon has occurred because of the rapid decline in trade and communication costs caused by technological development, trade liberalization, and regional integration. The expansion of GVCs has also affected the development strategies of developing economies. On the one hand, it is no longer necessary or efficient to build an entire value chain from scratch through infant industry protection, as assumed in Akamatsu’s (1962) model. Rather, a country can specialize in a niche segment of the value chain and then proceed to a higher value chain activity through its own upgrade efforts. On the other hand, the globalization of the economy, spurred by trade liberalization and economic integration, has narrowed the policy space for developing countries, making it increasingly difficult to protect infant industries. Against this background, trade in value added has been explored as a method of analyzing international trade, where production processes have been increasingly fragmented across national borders and the difference between gross and value-added exports has grown rapidly.Footnote 1 In particular, VS (vertical specialization; i.e., foreign content in exports) and VS1 (domestic content used as an input for re-exports) were originally developed by Hummels et al. (2001). Subsequently, Daudin et al. (2011) presented VS1* (the domestic content of imports). Johnson and Noguera (2012) defined value-added exports. Koopman et al. (2014) synthesized these studies by tracing the value-added and double-counted elements contained in gross exports. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2017a) proposed alternative measures of GVC participation by decomposing value added and final product production in a different way and separating GVC participation into simple and complex GVC activities. Borin and Mancini (2019) proposed a different method of decompositions and developed GVC participation and vertical specialization measures that deal with double-counting terms differently. In another methodological direction, production length and a sector’s position (i.e., relative upstreamness or downstreamness) in a value chain has been explored by economists such as Fally (2012), Antràs et al. (2012), Antràs and Chor (2013), and Miller and Temurshoev (2017). Recently, Wang et al. (2017b) developed a new set of measures for the average production length and relative upstreamness in a value chain. However, many of these studies, which rely on the analysis of international input–output data, have focused on the structure of vertical trade particularly the acceleration of vertical fragmentation of the production process, and have not explored value chain mapping per se, which is a core element of conventional value chain analysis. Nevertheless, value chain mapping has been conducted using different strands of research. However, the major drawback of current value chain analyses—mainly conducted by sociologists, economic geographers, and business strategists—is the lack of objective or quantitative data. For instance, a value chain map is typically drawn using information collected via interviews or other secondary sources. Consequently, “the analysis and policy recommendations provided in GVC studies are often based on qualitative data and are therefore subjective” (Frederick 2014, p. 19). In addition, the above approach does not capture the secondary or indirect repercussions caused by the sequence of input–output relations (e.g., mining → refined petroleum → automotive parts → chemicals → motor vehicles, where only chemicals are counted as inputs to motor vehicles in conventional value chain analysis). To bridge this gap, this study introduces a method of value chain mapping using international input–output data. As shown below, this value chain mapping method, which is based on Ozaki’s (1980) unit structure analysis and framed with the general equilibrium framework, fills this void and provides objective information on the inter-industry transactions of goods and services, as well as primary input (value added) and final output (final demand) transactions, which emerge along the entire value chain. As an application of this method, this study investigates the agricultural value chains in three Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries: Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Unlike the machinery sector, for example, it is technically difficult for the agricultural sector to fragment the production process across space; however, it would still gain substantial benefits from participation in GVCs. First, modern agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and petroleum fuel, are often procured from abroad. Second, agricultural products are exported directly or indirectly as materials for food and other processed products consumed abroad. As shown below, agricultural value chains have been increasingly internationalized due to the progress of regional cooperation and integration among ASEAN countries since the early 1990s, although there is still room to benefit from GVC participation, especially in less developed countries such as Cambodia. This study uses the OECD’s inter-country input–output (ICIO) tables for 1995 and 2011 (2016 edition) to calculate trade in value added and to quantitatively demonstrate the transformation of the agricultural sector in these three GMS countries.Footnote 2 Furthermore, this study applies the value chain mapping method to the ICIO tables for 2011. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the value chain mapping method. Section 3 first compares the structure of the agricultural sector in the three GMS countries. This is then followed by the results of the trade in value-added analysis and the method of value chain mapping. The results indicate significant differences between the three countries in terms of the structure of their agricultural value chains, particularly the use of agricultural inputs, sourcing of foreign inputs, and access to foreign markets. Section 4 concludes the paper with a summary of the findings.",2

Case of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems model,December 2021,Abdul Aziz Bin Karia,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"External debt is borrowing monetary aids from the different monetary centers. This external monetary aid does not purely refer to the governments, and it also includes external borrowing from commercial banks, household and international financial institutions. One of the contributors towards the external debt is tax revenues when it is insufficient to finance excessive government expenditure. Malaysia is classified as one of the 15 most indebted low- and middle-income countries (Dupuis and Vachon 2017). External debt in Malaysia, which includes short-term, medium, and long-term debt, stood at RM873.8 billion which is equivalent to 71.08% of its gross domestic product (GDP) as of December 2016.Footnote 1 Moreover, based on data provided by World Bank (2018), the total external debt to gross national income ratio in Malaysia is recorded as the highest among all emerging economies which is equivalent to 69.58%. Furthermore, Malaysia’s external debt to export goods and services on primary income ratio was 38.81% in 2007. Ten years later, this ratio soared to 94.50% in 2016. As this ratio is equivalent to 100%, it gives us the impression that the export revenues from goods and services are no longer covering the external debt. Raising the ratio of external debt to export revenues leads to a risk of insolvency over a long period (Dupuis and Vachon 2017; Zhu et al. 2018). Data gathered on the ratio between international asset reserves to total external debt will shed more light on this area. In 2016, Malaysia’s total reserves-to-total external debt ratio were 47.15%, which implies that Malaysia’s international assets reserves to cover the external debt is less than 60%. Although Malaysia's external debt has increased dramatically, it is vital to finance the domestic sources to offset the development and other needs of a country (Siddique et al. 2016). Another concern is that the past literature has revealed that a rise in external debt can cause economic turmoil (Gupta et al. 2007; Catão and Milesi-Ferretti 2014). The neoclassical growth theory reveals that there is a strong positive correlation between economic growth and debt. Borrowing from abroad is healthy to finance investment, which significantly stimulates economic growth and vice-versa. However, most of these studies focused on the impact of external debt to economic growth and found that there is an inverse relationship between debt and economic growth (Adegbite et al. 2008; Panizza and Presbitero 2014; Zouhaier and Fatma 2014). In this sense, a higher (lower) level of external debt will burden (stimulate) economic growth. The noteworthy hypothesis from the study of Reinhart et al. (2012) reveals that as the debt to economic growth ratio increases above 90%, it will slow down the economic activity. Apart from slowing down the economic activity, it will also lead to the stagnation of growth. In a similar vein, Westphal and Rother (2012) also argued that economic growth and debt would have nonlinear relationship with a turning point. As the debt to economic growth ratio hits 90% to 100%, it will show signs of a turning point. Surprisingly, both of these studies are opposed to the public debt overhang theory. The hypotheses highlighted by the study of Reinhart et al. (2012) and Westphal and Rother (2012) should not be disregarded. Based on the previous empirical evidence in the literature, most of the areas of discussion that are highlighted focused primarily on the impact of external debt on economic growth. The determinants of external debt also should not be put aside. This is supported by the study of Mensah (2016), whereby the external debt is not granger caused to economic growth. However, economic growth is an influence on external debt. Therefore, the researcher is concerned with (1) how the economic growth will have a direct, inverse relationship with turning point towards Malaysia’s external debt? Relying on the theory built on tax smoothing approach to the fiscal policy proposed by Barro (1979), the government will use expansionary and contractionary fiscal policy to mitigate the tax rates from changing too steep. The government will run expansionary (contractionary) fiscal policy when high (low) government spending needs. Concerning this theory, varying the government expenditure is necessary to buffer the tax rate to perpendicular (Battaglini and Coate 2008). Therefore, to improvise the theory of tax smoothing approach Battaglini and Coate (2008) presented a dynamic political economy theory of public spending, taxation, and debt. Therefore, the tax revenue can be raised by two approaches; income tax and borrowing for the capital market. It is considered an excellent tool to finance government expenditure and essential in maintaining economic stability. As mentioned previously, raising external debt could harm economic activity. According to Feldstein (2015) and Zhu et al. (2018) increase in debt would slow down the economic activity, including social expenditure such as pensions and health programs. However, collecting more tax revenue could contribute to that process. In this perspective, the researcher believes that the policymakers are in a dilemma. If they consider increasing the social expenditure, it will accumulate more to the government expenditure, whereby this expenditure needs to be financed by external borrowing. Like two sides of the same coin, this will indirectly contribute more to the external debt. Furthermore, the so-called external debt is one of the components of public debt. As the public debt to economic growth ratio reaches 90 to 100% it will be stagnant and negative economic growth. Therefore, the researcher addressed the questions (2) Whether the increase in government expenditure should be finance by the external debt? (3) Is the turning point noticeable between tax revenue and government expenditure towards the external debt? Since the government expenditure is logically complementary to the national saving, it is important to shed more light on this aspect. The government is responsible for using its power in stabilizing the economy during inflation and economic downturn. The study of Holtfrerich et al. (2016) found that the government is said to stimulate economic growth by increasing its expenditure during the recession period. This is due to government expenditure being the stabilizing function. Since the gross domestic saving is the gross domestic product minus final consumption expenditure, an increase in government expenditure will reduce the national saving. The hypothesis highlighted by Fry (1989) reveals the effect of national saving and domestic investment ratios on external debt. It is said that the saving and domestic investment ratios show a downward slope as the external debt increases. Reflecting on this point, reduction (increase) in national saving will show the sign of increase (decrease) in government expenditure. The stabilizing function of government expenditure and national saving is opposite to one another. The finding of Mensah (2016) revealed that as the government expenditure increases, there would be a need to finance this expenditure from external borrowing. Therefore, the hypothesis highlighted by Fry (1989) should not be rejected. As a result, it is vital to induce a drop in external debt when the economy shows overheating signs. The government should show the quality to run up additional debt to overcome the recession (Holtfrerich et al. 2016). The previous literature is quite revealing on several points. However, in the eyes of the researcher, the question on (4) what will be the optimum point for government revenue, expenditure, and national saving in reducing the external debt is also important to be discussed in scholarly activities. Reflecting on the arguments raised in the literature, to the researcher’s knowledge, this is among the newest pieces of evidence to predict external debt using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. The ANFIS characteristics that are a hybrid between the artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) will answer the four research questions in the current work. The most important is that the ANFIS model’s superiority explains the external debt’s turning points that are still lacking in the scholarly activity. Regarding the ANFIS prediction, the three-dimensional surface diagram will determine the optimum points of economic growth, government revenue, expenditure, national savings, and external debt in Malaysia. Remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides theoretical background on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach (ANFIS), Sect. 3 presents data and the empirical results of external debt in Malaysia, and finally, Sect. 4 presents the conclusion and recommendations.",1

It is widely known that demographic change affects economic growth and that economic development influences family planning, leading to a change of demography in a society. Demographic change includes a wide variety of phenomena, including change in labor participation, such as employment and unemployment; subsequent shift in population age structure, which means an expanding or shrinking volume of working-age group; decline or rise in fertility; and life expectancy. Thus, it is clear that demography matters a great deal for economic growth. Input–output analysis has been widely applied to regional economic issues, such as identification of leading industries, impact of new industry establishment, and employment and unemployment (see Miller and Blair 2009), since it can provide a comprehensive picture of the whole industrial economy in terms of both demand (including consumption and capital formation) and supply (including compensation for workers and created value added). There is no doubt that the most important issue for regional economies is the existence of unemployment, employment, and household consumption. However, conventional input–output analysis has paid only limited attention to changes in output by industrial activities; furthermore, the framework excludes households, not to mention population and labor force. A body of work by Batey and co-researchers, particularly in the 1980s, has positively contributed to the field of the extended input–output model for demography, especially employment and unemployment in labor accounts (Batey and Madden 1981, 1988, 1999a, 1999b; Batey 1985; Batey and Weeks 1987, 1989; Batey et al. 1987). The development and potential of this model has been discussed by Batey and Rose (1990); more recently, the model has been reviewed in the context of declining regional economies (Batey 2018). The Batey–Madden model has four components: the economic (inter-industry) interaction submatrix, the demographic interaction submatrix, the demographic–economic interaction submatrix, and the economic–demographic interaction submatrix. Since the abovementioned works focus on the employment problem and the consumption associated with unemployment, the model interpretation has mainly focused on the demographic–economic interaction (or the impact of change in employment levels on consumption), and the economic–demographic interaction (or the impact of changes in production on employment). We find that there is relatively little investigation of the demographic interaction. Moreover, despite the significant academic contributions to the development of a consistent methodology for analyzing the economic–demographic relationship in the input–output framework, there have been few applications in this field. Considering the importance of demographic impact on the economy, this model has strong potential for further analysis of regional economic issues related to demography. Urbanization is a kind of substantial geographical change that involves massive labor movement from rural to urban areas. Certainly, urbanization has also been given extensive attention in the input–output literature in the context of environmental impact (e.g., Ala-Mantila et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015; Feng and Hubacek 2016). However, urbanization itself has been treated as an exogenous factor in this literature, and the direct relationship or interdependency between urbanization and economy has been ignored. This study aims to develop an extended input–output model for urbanization based on the Batey–Madden model by incorporating the “urbanization process”. This process is associated with one of the facets of demographic change and has received little attention in the literature. The effectiveness of the model is theoretically explored and empirically tested using Chinese data, which show rapid progress of urbanization in China. The paper consists of the following parts. Section 2 describes the extended model of demography that Batey and others focused on in their works. Then, we develop an input–output model for urbanization by applying the Batey–Madden model, and further discuss its multipliers. In Sect. 3, we present the empirical results of the Chinese urbanization process and explain how the model works. Finally, Sect. 4 discusses the results and concludes.",2

In terms of quantity, there is an increasing trend of RTA formation, and currently the cumulative notification of RTA in force reaches 471 while the number of physical RTA in force are 293.Footnote 1 Fiorentino et al. (2009) explain the current wave of RTA in four different but related ways. First, there is an increase in North–South RTA, a gradual replacement of the long established non-reciprocal system of preference, and an increasing number of south-south RTA. Second, there are an increasing number of cross-regional trade agreements. Third, there is a decreasing propensity for plurilateral RTA and a net increase in the number of bilateral RTA. Fourth, Free Trade Areas (FTA) is more attractive to countries that are committed to comprehensive trade liberalization compared to customs union and partial scope agreements. Eight building blocks Regional Economic Communities (REC) are recognized by African Union to facilitate the regional integration agenda in Africa and boost intra-Africa trade. Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is one of those regional economic integrations selected by the African Union for the formation of Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA). Out of 19 COMESA member countries, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Swaziland are negotiating to join COMESA FTA. Economic integration includes various forms of integration such as a free trade area, customs union, common market, economic union, and total economic integration (Balassa 2013). Several theoretical explanations are given for the formation and proliferation of RTAs in the form of FTA and customs union. The probability of FTA formation is higher when the partners are closer geographically, more distant from the rest of the world, larger and more similar in economic size, and further apart regarding per capita incomes (Baier and Bergstrand 2004). However, countries with similar economic structure, but different FTA structure, may have different propensities to form new FTAs. Hence, the existing relationship between FTA negotiating countries and third countries also force the two countries to form FTA (Chen and Joshi 2010). A more recent study further argues that the signing or deepening of one FTA can induce excluded nations to sign new FTA. Thus, FTAs are contagious (Baldwin and Jaimovich 2012). Empirical studies show that FTA increases member countries' bilateral trade through their trade creation effect when a member country's domestic production of an item falls and is displaced by low-cost production by a partner country (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). However, there is also a trade diversion effect on non-participating countries resulting from the issue of rules of origin. According to Krueger (1997), FTA, which maintains each country's individual external trade barriers, but removes barriers on trade between the member countries result in three related consequences; first, there is a possibility for 'trade deflection'. Second, Rules of Origins (RoOs) can in effect 'export protection' from one country to another. Third, the fact that protection rates are different implies that producers in partner countries cannot be facing common prices of tradable or of non-tradable that use significant quantities of tradable as inputs. Therefore, comparing FTAs and customs union based on welfare: an FTA can not lead to any more trade creation than can a customs union and, when RoOs export any protection, an FTA leads to more trade diversion than does a customs union.Footnote 2 On the other hand, whenever there is trade creation under customs union, it seems evident that it will also occur under an FTA, and there is no mechanism by which there might be more under an FTA. Nevertheless, countries might have tariff structures such that averaging of tariff rates resulted in higher effective protection levels under customs union than under an FTA, and that this could result in greater trade diversion under a customs union than under an FTA. Although there is more welfare gain associated with customs union, some countries may not agree to join customs union in the first place. However, the trade-diversion effects of customs union formation can induce those nations that were previously against membership to join and an economic incentive to join increases with the customs union size (domino effect of custom unions) (Baldwin 1993). Several studies on Africa reveal that regional economic integrations are not sufficient to increase intra-Africa trade, but there is strong evidence of a trade creation effect (Mevel and Karingi 2012; Mureverwi 2016; and Ngepah and Udeagha 2018). There is overall welfare gain from trade liberalization in most African REC, but the country-level welfare effect is unbalanced, and some countries experience welfare loss (Sawkut and Boopen 2010). In general, the welfare effects of FTA and customs union depend on the pre-existing trade share between negotiating countries; the larger the share is, the larger the net trade creation and the smaller the trade diversion effect. Likewise, when pre-existing tariffs are very high (so that there is little trade to divert) or very low (so that the costs of trade diversion are low), welfare is more likely to improve with the formation of customs union. Besides, the size of the tariff reduction also determines the welfare effect from FTAs and customs union. Themain purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of tariff reduction under three regional trade arrangements on the economy of Ethiopia. First, Ethiopia is a member of COMESA, but not a signatory of the free trade area. Therefore, we evaluate the macroeconomic and welfare impact of the free trade area between Ethiopia and COMESA member countries. Second, COMESA member countries agreed to levy a Common External Tariff (CET) on non-member countries and form a customs union. Hence, we extend our analysis to the case where Ethiopia joins the COMESA customs unions in an operational free trade area. Third, there are ongoing trade negotiations between African countries and the European Union (EU), European Partnership Agreement (EPA), to remove the tariffs imposed by African countries on EU products. We use static Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, version 9 database to achieve the three objectives. Analysis of deep regional integration between COMESA and Ethiopia, is vital for the following reasons; first, Ethiopia is the fourth largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the country has an abundant cheap labor force and a market of over 100 million people. Second, the Ethiopian economy is highly protected in Africa by a substantial tariff rate, and has very low trade with COMESA countries. Third, from a geopolitical perspective, Ethiopia has a significant place in the horn of Africa. This study contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, despite several studies on COMESA, there has been little analysis of different regional trade arrangements. In this study, an important distinction is made between free trade areas, customs union, and the European Partnership Agreement. Second, unlike previous studies, the COMESA customs union scenarios are designed at the detailed HS6 level. Third, to account for unemployment in Ethiopia, and other COMESA countries, the model assumes endogenous unskilled labor supply, and exogenous wage. However, for scenario1, we provide a result with standard model closure. Further, 140 regions and 57 sectors are aggregated into 18 regions and 18 sectors (Appendices I and II). The empirical literature on different regional trade agreements in Africa is reviewed in Sect. 2. Then, a brief description of COMESA member countries’ economies is analyzed using social and macroeconomic variables in Sect. 3. After that, the protection patterns of COMESA and Ethiopia with other regions are explained. We explain the model database and simulations in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the macroeconomic and welfare results under different scenarios, and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",2
10.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,12 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-020-00231-3,Producing a village input–output table (VIOT) from household survey data: a case study of a VIOT for a rural village in northern Lao PDR,December 2021,Soulixay Hongsakhone,Moinul Islam,Masaru Ichihashi,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The strong human relations through trade, the exchange of goods and services between households in disadvantaged areas lead to an increasing role of economic interactions and potentially wider economic development and growth. The main purpose of this study is to make a village input–output table (VIOT) from household survey data to examine the interdependency among households through transactions in an isolated and disadvantaged village in a developing country. In doing so, we conducted household surveys in a rural village in northern Luang Prabang province, Lao PDR in 2015 and 2016 to gather all relevant data and information. VIOT construction is simple, but it is a useful tool to know the economic transactions among villagers in the village because the information contained in such tables is useful not only for describing a circular structure of flows of major goods and money within a village, but also for revealing the effects of production in the village and providing us with directional pair data for buyers and sellers, which can be used to estimate commodity flows between households and examine the causal effects of a treatment by following a micro-econometric methodology. Thus, this VIOT is an appropriate approach and is particularly applicable for disadvantaged areas where it is often difficult to obtain socioeconomic data, such as developing countries, to fully analyze the reciprocity of rural households through their economic transactions. By using the VIOT model, we can identify who are the key market players, sellers and buyers, as well as producers and consumers in the village. Moreover, we could explore the immobilization in a community by examining the circular structure of flows of goods and money in that society. In our opinion, we assume that households exhibiting fewer trade transactions with others tend to present lower incomes as well as minimal opportunities to obtain goods and escape from poverty, while households that frequently exhibit trade transactions with others tend to present increased opportunities to receive income and overcome poverty. Therefore, households with very frequent trade transactions with others will gain greater incomes to reduce poverty, and households exhibiting less trade or no trade transactions with others will have low incomes, leading to poverty. This VIOT method can provide basic information about this issue and can be used to form economic policies for goals, such as poverty reduction by providing information on households playing a key role in the village. Furthermore, this VIOT can be used to measure income gaps or the expansion of poverty based on the frequency of trade between households because interdependency occurs in human relationships through trade. In many rural areas in developing countries, the producers of goods, such as farmers, are also the consumers in the village, which means that each household depends on the other households for both production and their livelihood. In such areas where the same household or person has characteristics of both a producer and a consumer, the VIOT model is therefore an advantageous tool for analysis. While classical economists such as Smith and Marx identified principles of economic development through trade and capital circulation, it is widely known that income gaps frequently emerge. Income gaps and their causes are among the most fundamental issues in economics, along with trade or the exchange of goods. The input–output (IO) model developed by Leontief has long been a useful tool for investigating interdependency among industries and key sectors in the economy. This model, therefore, was used to develop the concept of the multi-sectoral multiplier in the industrial sector, which was derived from the macroeconomic multiplier developed by Keynes. This multi-sectoral multiplier can be used as an index of the interdependency of industries. Traditionally, the IO model has been employed to relate the product flows from producer to the consumer sectors and is constructed from observed data for economic areas such as nations or regions. Most researchers focused on IO models and their implications for the specific national, regional or international and inter-regional IO studies. Their studies have used IO analysis to evaluate economic impact of industrial sectors on a national, international and inter-regional level. There have been several types of IOTs constructed and compiled by researchers for these studies over past decades. For example, Isard (1951) described how to compile an inter-regional input–output (IRIO) table for the United States. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2015) attempted to construct a province-level IRIO model for China for 2002, and Dietzenbacher et al. (2013) built world input–output tables (WIOTs) for 40 countries plus the rest of the world. However, this type of research on IO studies at bottom-up level, especially from village perspective has been rarely conducted because researchers often lack enough information and socioeconomic statistics. Moreover, survey approach and techniques are costly and time-consuming. Few studies used rural IO information from household survey data. Taylor et al. (1996) study is one among the previous studies that used rural input–output information from the household surveys, including a social accounting matrix (SAM) and computational general equilibrium (CGE). The authors focused on the main flows of money, including income; therefore, the sector sizes of their input–output tables were relatively small, and they included only five sectors, namely farming, livestock, resource extraction, construction and village retail activities. The authors used 1982 household survey data from a major migrant-sending rural village in central Mexico to analyze the economic structure of a migrant-sending rural economy. The results showed that the production linkages within the village economy were weak, although there were strong consumption and investment linkages, especially for food and livestock. In addition, Lewis and Thorbecke (1992) employed a SAM approach to examine the economic linkages in a small regional economy in Kenya: their results showed that agricultural activities had the largest impact on income generation. Subramanian and Qaim (2009) developed a micro SAM to analyze the effects of agricultural biotechnology application on cotton production for rural households in India, using village census data from four states to analyze the income effects for large farms. Martin and Holden (2004) also built a small village SAM based on a household survey that they conducted in rural Mozambique to capture tree resources and assess the multiplier effects of charcoal production, and Agaje (2008) extended their village SAM to capture household income losses due to soil degradation. Faẞe and Grote (2014) developed environmentally extended village SAMs for Tanzania to model the input–output relationships among households, to examine the transactions of an entire village economy. These previous studies related to SAM applications were constructed from household survey data, but they mainly used aggregated tables with few sectors. However, A SAM approach does not necessarily include significant IO detail, and the IO structure of the SAM seems to be small and captured major accounts: production activities, factors of production, institutions including households, capital, and rest of the village. In general, an input–output (IO) analysis is a quantitative technique for studying the interdependence of production sectors in an economy. These inter-industry linkages have been studied since the end of 1950s, with the main purpose of identifying the so-called key industries or key sectors that are essential for economic growth and development. The backward and forward linkages first introduced by Hirschman (1958) are the concept of inter-industry linkages analysis. Then, these linkages have been widely applied for interdependence analysis (see, e.g., Chenery and Watanabe 1958; Hewings and Romanos 1981; Hewings 1982: Defourny and Thorbecke 1984; Cmiel and Gurgul 2002; San Cristobal and Biezma 2006; Temurshoev and Oosterhaven 2014; Gurgul and Majdosz 2005; Gurgul and Lach 2015, 2016, 2018), etc. These studies are the main motivating thought for this study, and by following these ideas, we attempt to make use of VIOT created from our own household survey data to investigate the interdependence among households through their trade transactions in the corresponding village. This VIOT model could be an applicable method for examining inter-household dependency dataFootnote 1 and capturing the economic structure of the village, household production, and consumption, which improves our understanding of economic interdependence and transactions among key agents in isolated villages or disadvantaged areas, allowing us to identify potential areas for development interventions, in addition to providing a helpful tool and reference for VIOT studies, for scholars conducting similar studies in the future. The information on transactions for intermediate sales and purchases of goods and services between households in the village is the key for the VIOT construction. Theoretically, IO model follows an accounting framework in which the total receipts by sellers must balance the total expenditures by buyers. By that conversion, total output is equal to total input for each producing sector in the economy. Surprisingly, when we conducted our household survey, we investigated economic activities related to production and consumption over the previous year, and there was a gap in the balances of sales and purchases for each good in our survey data because respondents did not recall exactly how often they had sold and purchased their goods from others over the previous year. We also faced a difficulty dealing with consumption data distribution, because households did not know correctly how much they consumed each commodity they bought from others, so we had to solve problems in estimating a consumption ratio and then redistributed it in each household, this is an artificial value in consumption vector. Our household surveys were conducted in March 2015 and March 2016 in Phonxay village, which is situated in the northeastern part of Luang Prabang province, Lao PDR, close to the border with Vietnam. It is a typical disadvantaged village and community under the poverty line in an Asian country. As of 2016, there were 124 households, which had 720 inhabitants in the village. Total annual household income is 1,705,230,000 Kip (approximately US$ 213,145 at market exchange rate on 1 US dollar/8000 Kip). The average monthly per capita income is 197,365 Kip and the major source of household income is rice, contributing 778,640,000 Kip, or 45.66% of the total annual household income, followed by non-timber forest products (NTFPs) at 428,010,000 Kip (25.10%), livestock at 330,580,000 Kip (19.39%), and wages and salaries at 99,630,000 Kip (5.84%). According to our survey data, the Gini coefficient in terms of per capita income in this village is 0.6607, which means that the market income disparity among households is extremely high measured at market prices. The remainder of this paper is divided as follows: Sect. 2 briefly introduces the collection of relevant data from an own household survey and then a summary of those data. The conversion of household survey data to an IO framework is explicitly described in Sect. 3. A sample VIOT analysis and the relations among households are described in Sect. 4, including the total output multiplier and backward and forward linkage analyses, to examine the degree of inter-household dependency in transactions. The final section summarizes main results and provides concluding remarks.",3
11.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,31 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-022-00293-5,Quality of Indonesia’s domestic institutions and export performance in the era of global value chains,December 2022,Arief Bustaman,Rina Indiastuti,Titik Anas,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"For countries that adopt an open economic system, foreign trade, especially exports, has a very important role in driving national economic growth. International trade has played an important role in the process of economic development in many developing countries. This is because international trade, especially exports, is a significant source of foreign exchange, can stimulate domestic production, and can create jobs. Palley (2012) notes that the export-led growth strategy was applied in several countries in the Asian region, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, which at the time were developing countries in the 1970–1980 era; and they were then followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia in the 1980s to 1990s. Islam (1998) shows that there is a causal relationship between exports and economic growth in the economies of India, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand. Furthermore, the export-led growth strategy that emerged in the 1970s replaced the import substitution strategy, which has led to the emergence of new industrial countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Mexico. Myint (1979) explains that the export-led growth mechanism can operate through three channels. First, expanding exports will increase direct profits from trade and facilitate economic growth. Second, exports contribute to economic development, especially through the provision of foreign exchange for developing countries for the purchase of capital goods and other inputs from abroad. Third, international trade and expansion of exports, indirectly, have an impact on productivity efficiency in the country as a consequence of economic openness, facilitating the spread of new needs and activities, new technology, and new economic organisation. In the case of Indonesia, exports have long been one of the targets for boosting its economic growth. The export sector has been playing an important role in the Indonesian economy from the mid-1970s to the present. From the 1970s to the early 1980s, when world oil prices began to decline, oil and gas exports became a priority (Soesastro and Basri 2005). In response to the decline in world oil prices, the Indonesian government began to focus on manufacturing exports since the beginning of 1983. From 1983 to 1995, more than 24 economic reform packages were designed to increase investment, reduce trade barriers, increase efficiency, and strengthen the non-oil and gas export economy. This economic transformation enhanced Indonesia’s economic performance, as demonstrated by an annual GDP growth of 6.3% between 1985 and 1990 (Soesastro and Basri 2005). After 32 years of President Soeharto’s reign (in office: 27th March 1968–21st May 1998) in the New Order era, economic reforms in the various eras of the next presidencies have continued with exports still being a policy priority and they have contributed significantly to the Indonesian economy. However, despite various economic reform programmes under different regimes, Indonesia’s export value still shows a relatively poor performance. For example, in the last 3 decades it has always been consistently below that of Malaysia and Thailand (as the two exporting countries in the region of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN). Figure 1 shows the export value of Indonesia and 3 major exporter countries in the ASEAN region, namely, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam (hereinafter referred to as the main ASEAN exporting countries). In the 1980s to 1993, Indonesia’s export value surpassed that of Thailand, but was below that of Malaysia. From 1993 to 2016, Indonesia was below that of Malaysia and Thailand. Even since 2015, Vietnam’s export value has surpassed that of Indonesia. Source: www.wits.worldbank.org Export value of selected ASEAN countries in US$. Vertical axis is export value in US$. A number of empirical studies have pointed out the cause of stagnation, if not decline, Indonesia’s export performance is not caused by uncompetitive exchange rates or higher labour costs, but is rather due to a decrease in foreign direct investment (Adams et al. 2006) and foreign trade policies that do not support export performance Soesastro and Basri 2005). Furthermore, Athukorala (2006) also emphasised the slow pace of microeconomic reform after the 1997 crisis as one of the causes of Indonesia’s poor export performance. Athukorala’s argument is also supported by Molnar and Lesher (2008) who state that internal constraints and developments in the international market have hindered Indonesia’s competitiveness, including the relationship to trade policies. Another study, by Wengel and Rodriguez (2006), examined Indonesian exports by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and found that the overly complicated regulations and decentralisation in Indonesia made the costs of setting up a business in Indonesia too burdensome for SMEs, and are among the highest in Asia. The various export-inhibiting problems mentioned above are better known in the economic literature as institutional factors. In addition, a recent study by Isnawangsih and Lu (2018) recommends the importance of Indonesia in improving regulatory quality to increase global value chain participation. Thus, it is imperative for Indonesia to have good domestic institutions if it wants to improve its export performance by shifting reliance from raw materials exports, which tend to have low prices, to goods of higher quality and higher value. There are several institutions that publish data on the quality of institutions in various countries in the world. For example, Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) data published by the World Bank since 1996 can reflect the quality of institutions in political, legal and economic aspects in 215 countries. WGI measures institutional governance using 6 dimensions, namely, Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control for Corruption. Other available data for institutional qualities are law, bureaucracy and democratic accountability that published by the PRS Group which provides data for 140 countries; and POLITY IV institutional data published by the Center for Systemic Peace. Figure 2 illustrates the quality of institutions in Indonesia which is sourced from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). Source: Worldwide Governance Indicators Six dimensions of institutions quality in Indonesia. Value of institution quality is an index ranging from −2.5 to 2.5, with a score of 2.5 representing the strongest institutions. World Governance Indicators calculates the quality of institutions in 215 countries on a scale from the worst (−2.5) to the best (2.5). From the figure above, it can be seen that during 2000 to 2017, the majority of the quality of Indonesian institutions were in the poor category, as reflected by numbers below 0. While the components that had positive numbers were only found in the last few years, namely, on the voice and accountability since 2012 and the government effectiveness since 2017. However, throughout this period, all components showed significant improvement. For comparison, Fig. 3 shows the quality of institutions of four quality dimensions related to trade (i.e., Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control for Corruption) in four exporting countries in the ASEAN region. Source: Worldwide Governance Indicators Four dimensions of institutions quality related to international trade of main ASEAN exporter countries. Value of institution quality is an index ranging from −2.5 to 2.5, with a score of 2.5 representing the strongest institutions. In the figure above, it can be seen that from 2000 to 2018, the quality of Indonesia's domestic institutions (shown by blue lines) was generally below Malaysia and Thailand (red and grey lines, respectively). Meanwhile, compared to Vietnam (yellow lines), Indonesia only has advantages in terms of regulatory quality. These figures might explain why Indonesia is still struggling to increase its involvement in global value chain compared to other three countries in the ASEAN region. Furthermore, in the era of trade liberalisation and the global value chain of the 2000s, Indonesia still struggles to increase its export performance, despite its involvement in several free trade agreements. One of Indonesia’s efforts to improve export performance is by conducting international trade cooperation at various levels (bilateral, regional, and multilateral). Indonesia has committed to actively participate in efforts to integrate the world economy, especially through the trade sector, and Indonesia has joined in various free trade and cooperation agreements. Table 1 contains information on Indonesia’s trade cooperation that has been in effect: Through the above trade agreements, Indonesia experienced tariff reduction on its export to trading partners. For example, in the context of ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, on average tariff reductions faced by Indonesia exports in the destination countries were not only quite significant but also considered to be low. The tariff imposed by neighbouring countries in ASEAN has been as low as below 1% since 2010, as depicted in Fig. 4. Source: www.wits.worldbank.org Average import tariffs on Indonesia export to ASEAN countries. Value of average import tariffs is in percent. With the global production network phenomenon, it is imperative to consider the composition of commodities in analysing the trade performance of a country. In other words, determine if a country is trading more value-added products such as intermediate, capital or consumer goods relative to lower value added ones such as raw material. In the context of the global value chain (GVC), one factor that needs to be considered is China’s role as a manufacturing centre in the Asia region. As stated by Athukorala (2006), although growth in trade based on product fragmentation has become a global phenomenon, more important and rapid developments have occurred in the East and Southeast Asia region than in other regions of the world. Since the mid-2000s, many companies around the world have shifted their production processes to China with various inputs produced around the world. Indonesia and the other ASEAN countries have formed the ASEAN-China FTA since 2005. Figure 5 shows the main ASEAN exporting countries product compositions (left-side chart) and their intermediate goods export to China (right-side chart). Source: www.wits.worldbank.org Selected ASEAN countries export compositions and their intermediate goods export to China. Note to the right graph: Value of intermediate goods export to China, in million US$. The data in the left chart of Fig. 5 show that the structure of Indonesia’s export products has remained relatively unchanged between 2000 and 2017, and this pattern is different from other countries. Indonesia’s raw materials exports have experienced an increase in composition, while other countries have tended to stagnate or even decline and switch to other higher value-added commodities, such as intermediate goods, consumer goods, or capital goods. Furthermore, the right chart in Fig. 5 depicts exports of intermediate goods to China, which is considered to be the world’s factory for manufacturing and assembling. It can be seen that from 1990 to 2003, the export value of Indonesian intermediate goods to China was higher than the three countries. However, since 2004 Malaysia and Thailand have had better export performance in intermediate goods than Indonesia, and since 2009, the export value gap has widened. This figure shows that Malaysia and Thailand have taken advantage of the ASEAN-China FTA, while Indonesia has not. What is even more worrying is that the trend of Vietnam’s export value that exceeds Indonesia began to appear in 2016. Based on these data, it can be said that Indonesia’s export performance is getting worse in the context of the global production network. This is also supported by empirical research conducted by Jongwanich (2010), who found that Indonesia, as a country that has not actively participated in the manufacturing product fragmentation process, is marked by the smallest growth in the share of manufactured exports among other countries in the ASEAN region. He specifically emphasizes the possibility of ""Dutch Disease"" phenomenon experienced by Indonesia, where exports of natural resource products dominate manufacturing exports. Furthermore, Jongwanich (2010) explains that among the 9 countries of the East Asia and Southeast Asia Region covered in his study, Indonesia has different export patterns and trends. For example, data shows that the other eight countries have a positive trend of increasing exports of products classified as machinery and transportation equipment (SITC 7), while Indonesia has not experienced a change in product composition, which is still textile and footwear products (SITC 8). The importance for a country to export more varied, high-tech, and value-added goods is increasingly relevant in the era of globalisation and the global production network (Khandelwal 2010; Sheng and Yang 2016). This argument is based on the consideration that global production network involves contracts among firms, often a long term one. The research of Funke and Ruhwedel (2001) shows that producing highly differentiated export goods provides a competitive advantage that allows a country to sell more products. The results obtained conclusively support the hypothesis that increasing export variation both horizontally and vertically may be as important as having competitiveness in the aspect of price. Fugazza (2005) explains that institutional factors play an important role in supporting export competitiveness and performance at a more advanced stage, i.e., exports commodities that are capital intensive or differentiated products or products of higher quality. Furthermore, Dollar and Kidder (2017) explain that countries with good institutional quality, for example, property rights and rule of law, will tend to have good performance in global value chains (GVCs). Similarly, Nunn (2007) found that high-tech industries that produce more specialized products are sensitive to institutional quality. Poor institutions may, therefore, limit domestic production of this type of intermediate products. Several studies show the importance of improving the quality of institutions as a companion to the policy of carrying out trade liberalisation through tariff reduction (Dollar and Kraay 2003; Méon and Sekkat 2008). The argument of Jansen and Nordås (2004) may apply to the Indonesian case. In their study, they explained that the tariff reduction by trading partner countries was not sufficient to improve export performance, due to the high transaction costs faced by exporters. For example, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators data for 2018 show that time to export, in terms of hours, that are needed for documentary compliance in Indonesia is the longest (61.3 h) compared to its peer exporter countries in ASEAN (i.e., Malaysia: 10 h; Thailand: 11 h; and Vietnam: 50 h) as shown in Table 2. The primary objective of this research is to analyse the role of institutions quality on the Indonesian export in the era of global value chain and will be elaborated in the following way. First, the role of institutions will be analysed in the exports of four different product categories based on UNCTAD classification of Stage of Processing, namely, raw material, intermediate, consumer and capital goods. Raw materials and intermediate goods are used for further production chain abroad (i.e., forward value chain), consumer goods are intended for final users, while capital goods comprising machinery used to produce other goods abroad. Export of consumer goods by Indonesia although intended for final consumers abroad, several products are considered to be value chain products. For example, several international brands clothing and shoes products that being produced in Indonesia have imported components source from other countries (i.e., backward value chain). As suggested in the literature, the impact of the role of institutions on exports may differ between primary, low value-added products (i.e., raw material) and manufactured, higher value-added products (i.e., intermediate, capital and consumer goods). In the context of Indonesia, which, historically, still struggle to increase its export performance by shifting reliance on raw material exports to higher value commodities, it is important to analyse whether institutional quality influence each commodity group differently. Second, this study evaluates whether there are different roles among domestic and trading partner institutions within the scope of Indonesian export of the four commodities. The literature suggests that domestic quality institution is more important than trading partners’ institution. Thus, examining the different quality of the roles of domestic vs trading partner institutions in the scope of the four group of commodities may shed some light on the future policy direction in domestic institutional quality. Third, given the fact that despite Indonesia’s export performance are relatively not improving regardless of its involvement in several free trade agreements, this study also evaluates whether the qualities of institutions are more important than tariff reductions. In this case, tariff reductions are considered as a proxy of free trade agreements by Indonesia. The novelty and contribution of this paper to the body of economic literature on institutions and trade, resides through its rather disaggregated nature of commodities under consideration. First, taking into account the fact that most of the studies examining the relationship between institutional quality are at the level of aggregate trade, and there have been few studies analysing the influence of institutions across different commodity groups, where these studies show that institutions influence more higher value-added products, this study will contribute by adding to the literature on how institutions can affect exports at a disaggregated level. In addition, based on the author's observations of the few studies studying the impact of institutional quality on international trade, no one has ever used disaggregated data of the UNCTAD classification: raw material, intermediate goods, consumer goods, capital goods. Second, considering the current microeconomic reforms in Indonesia as a developing country, the results of this study may be useful for further policy improvements in Indonesia, as well as other developing countries in general in an effort to increase the ability to export products with higher added value and more specifically to be more integrated into global value chains.",

These studies determined the amount of damage caused in Japan and its various regions. A report by the Cabinet Office (2013) estimated direct damage from natural disasters to be between 97.6 and 169.5 trillion yen, and the full amount of damage has been estimated to be between 35.1 and 50.8 trillion yen in the Nankai Trough earthquake. Concerning the economic damage caused by cyberattacks, CSIS (2021) indicated that the damage exceeded USD 1 trillion and accounted for 1% of the global gross domestic product. Despite this huge loss, studies on the economic damage caused by cyberattacks have been restricted to micro-analyses. Few studies have performed comprehensive and quantitative damage analyses, including an analysis of spillover damage. Although the government of Japan has adopted several cyber security policies, such as supply chain security for critical infrastructures in CS (2021), it must be understood that an objective and quantitative analysis of results is the key to effective policymaking. This study devised a method for quantitatively estimating the economic damage caused by cyberattacks in Japan and contributed to improving the accuracy of damage prediction and the formulation of various national measures. Specifically, we devised a method to analyze Japan's economic damage caused by cyberattacks using production functions and input–output analysis. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews research analyzing the economic damage caused by natural disasters and cyberattacks. Section 3 presents a method for estimating the direct and spillover damage. Section 4 presents our estimation results and provides a discussion of our findings. Section 5 presents the conclusions of the findings and plans for future research.",2

A panel data analysis,December 2022,Bruno Ferreira de Oliveira,Rodolfo Tomás da Fonseca Nicolay,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of the industrial sector for development is widely reported [e.g., Rostow (1958), Gerschenkron (1962), Schumpeter (1985), Prebisch (1949), and Kaldor (1966)]. According to Szirmai and Verspagen (2015), the main characteristics of the industrial sector that qualify it as the vector for sustained growth of the economy are: (i) empirical correlation between GDP per capita and the share of industry in GDP; (i) high productivity compared to the other sectors of the economy; (iii) existence of static and dynamic economies of scale [e.g., Kaldor (1966)]; (iv) existence of chaining effect of the industrial sector and spillover of technological content from the industrial sector to the other sectors of the economy [e.g., Perroux (1955), Hirschman (1958)]; (v) special opportunities for technological development, given that the locus of the innovative process is industry [e.g., Lazonick (2005)],; (vi) relevant impact of technological development in the industrial sector on extractive and capital-intensive services segments, such as mining, utilities, construction, transportation and urban mobility. The key process for the dynamism of the industry is associated with the innovative process [e.g., Cohen and Levinthal (1990), Teece et al. (1997), and Bell and Pavitt (1995)]. The learning capacity of organizations is an important element of business survival conditions [e.g., Teece (2009)], to provide opportunities for differentiation from competitors, given the hostile environment of international competition. This process is related to routine and interactive economic activities between internal and external agents of the firm, highlighting the expensive, social and collective nature of learning, making endogenous the technological and organizational changes of firms in the development process [e.g., Nelson and Winter (1982), Edquist and Lundvall (1993), Malerba (2002), Edquist (2005), Lazonick (2005), Lundvall et al. (2009) and Fagerberg (2017)]. Industrial development assumes evolutionary and disruptive attributes for the alteration and conformation of new productive structures. In this sense, a weakened country’s innovative process results in a low innovative capacity of organizations and countries. It may imply the reduction of the degree of industrial densification. Moreover, low innovative capacity, stemming from low learning capacity, resulting in adverse conditions for absorptive capacity, dynamic capacity, and adverse conditions for accumulation of technological competencies, may influence the industrial competitiveness in international trade, given that technological skills shape the competitive environment of industrial companies [e.g., Cantwell (2005), Fagerberg et al. (2007), Melo et al. (2015) and UNIDO (2019)]. Thus, the low innovative capacity may reduce the industry capacity, reducing the observed impact of the industry on society. In the last decades, the debate on the deindustrialization process has grown. Some countries have shown a reduction in the participation of industry in GDP and loss of industrial competitiveness, which has motivated countries such as the United States and Germany to adopt policies of incentives and protection for industrial sectors in response to the industrial development of East Asia, especially China [see, e.g., Oliveira et al. (2021)]. The literature has developed based on the study of the deindustrialization process in advanced or developed countries. The work of Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999) analyses the process of deindustrialization for developed countries, treated in terms of the reduction of the relative share of industrial employment over time. Tregenna (2008) associates the process of deindustrialization to the joint occurrence in the reduction of the relative participation of industrial employment, as well as the participation of industry in GDP, over time. The deindustrialization process can occur naturally because of the development process. When countries reach economic maturity, associated with high per capita income levels, it reduces the participation of industrial jobs and products [e.g., Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999)]. However, deindustrialization can be premature or early when the relative participation of industry and industrial employment peaks at relatively low levels of per capita income [e.g., Felipe et al. (2019) and Rodrik (2015)], especially for countries in the middle-income trap [see, e.g., Atolia et al. (2018)]. The literature lists the effect of relative prices as a determinant for the deindustrialization process [e.g., Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999)] due to the change in productivity levels between the service and industrial sectors [e.g., Rowthorn and Coutts (2004) and Palma (2005)], causing the productivity to unbalance [e.g., Kollmeyer (2009)]. Another determinant reported concerns the effects of international trade on the productive structure and industrial jobs, translated in terms of the degree of openness of the economy, trade balance and North–South trade structure [e.g., Alderson (1999), Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999), Rowthorn and Coutts (2004), Kollmeyer (2009), Kang and Lee (2011) and Van Neuss (2018)]. In addition, Dutch disease is reported as a determinant of deindustrialization [e.g., Palma (2005), Bresser-Pereira (2008) and Bacha (2013)], exchange rate [e.g., Marconi and Rocha (2012) and Cruz (2014)], low investment rates of the economy [e.g., Rowthorn and Coutts (2004) and Kang and Lee (2011)], income distribution [e.g., Cruz (2014)], liberalizing policies, especially in Latin America [e.g., Daspugta and Singh (2006) and Bogliaccini (2013)], and foreign direct investment flows [e.g., Alderson (1999) and Kang and Lee (2011)]. Based on these, the main objective of the article is to test whether the innovative capacity represents a determinant of the deindustrialization process of countries. The specific objectives of the study are: (i) to verify if there is a difference in magnitude of the impact of the innovation process on production, industrial employment, and export quality in the industrial sector; and (ii) to verify if there are differences in the impact of the indicators related to the innovation process on the variables related to industrial densification by income level. The novel in the present work is the analysis of the possible effects of innovative activity on the deindustrialization process. The article tests the hypothesis that the low innovative capacity of a country may affect the degree of productive densification of industry. It derives from low learning capacity, resulting in adverse conditions of absorptive capacity, dynamic capability, and adverse conditions for the accumulation of technological skills. In addition, the results presented to assist in the formulation of public policies more in line with the reality of the countries. In addition to this section, the present study will include a methodological section, followed by the analysis of the results found and the final considerations.",

Banking stability is a gauge to decide whether an economy is adequately resilient enough to resist both internal and external shocks and having safe and sound banking help avoid costly banking system crises and their negative consequences on the real economy. The historical evidence shows that those financial crises which had a stronger association with the banking sector had a more adverse impact on real economic growth. On the other hand, rising instability in the banking sector leads to decreasing the efficiency of resource allocation and increasing uncertainty about future output growth (Jokipii and Monnin 2013). Besides, deterioration in the banking sector stability has an unfavorable impact on the stability of financial markets and the real sector output. Christiano et al. (2010) and Campbell et al. (2016) underscored that disruption of the banking system decreases the ability of banks to lessen the asymmetric information effectively and there is a significant long-run nexus between banking instability and the credit-risk premium faced by businesses. Over the last three decades, several scholars investigating the determinants of instability in the banking sector aimed to enhance stability and curb excessive taking risky activities. The studies revealed that the banking-specific factors, namely, capital requirements (Danisman and Demirel 2019), market power (Tabak et al. 2015), and income divarication (AlKhouri and Arouri 2019) negatively affect risk-taking, whereas inefficiency and credit risk has a positive effect on banks’ risk-taking (Hassan et al. 2019). Besides, Ioannidou and Penas (2010) and Athari and Bahreini (2021) highlighted that country-specific factors, namely, deposit insurance and financial market development positively impact banks’ risk-taking. More specifically, some studies showed that country risk factors have a significant effect on increasing bank instability. Rezgallah et al. (2019) and Athari (2021) revealed that banks are triggered to take excessive risky activities by a rising in domestic political risk to compensate for unexpected future losses and avoid earnings volatility. Calmes and Théoret (2014) and Athari (2021) also argued that banks by increasing economic instability have more incentive to take riskier investments as they have less ability to forecast better investment opportunities, have lower profitability, and are more exposed to adverse selection and moral hazard problems. While the effect of political and economic instability has been analyzed, much less attention has been paid to how banking sectors are influenced extensively. This study contributes by the inclusion of novel the political risk index and economic risk index to empirically corroborate the existence of a nexus between the country’s risk factors and risk-taking in the banking sector. These indices are so comprehensive and also accurate proxies for measuring the political and economic risk factors.Footnote 1 Another novelty of this study is also to answer how risk-raking in the banking sector reacted to the domestic political and economic risks in the different geographical regions. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of domestic political and economic risk indices, as well as other traditional factors, on risk-taking in the banking sector both regionally and globally. In our knowledge, this study is the first study to investigate this relationship from this perspective, and the findings open an entirely new discussion in the banking literature. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology. Section 3 explains the results and discussions. Section 4 concludes the article.",2
11.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,08 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-022-00284-6,Physical climate change and the sovereign risk of emerging economies,December 2022,Hannes Boehm,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As of 2020, human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0\(^{\circ }\)C of global heating compared to pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2018). Climate-related natural disasters, infectious diseases, species extinction and threats to economic prosperity as well as food, health and water supply are projected to increase dramatically with further warming. However, the IPCC (2018) also emphasizes that the 1.0\(^{\circ }\)C increase witnessed so far has already led to more extreme weather events, changing natural systems and economic damages. Furthermore, the report states that the burden of climate change will be particularly heavy for developing countries in the global South. In this paper, I exploit temperature fluctuations of past years which represent physical climate change risks in line with the 1.0\(^{\circ }\)C heating witnessed so far. I contribute to the literature by linking these movements in temperature to the sovereign creditworthiness of, potentially climate-vulnerable, emerging market economies. Though the literature on the economic effects of temperature fluctuations is rich, the link to sovereign bond performances or sovereign risk has so far been missing. Despite this gap in the literature, climate change can pose a significant threat for the creditworthiness of sovereigns according to several regulatory bodies. For instance, a report on the financial risks from climate change by the Bank of England (2018) states: “The increasing frequency of severe weather events could also impact macroeconomic conditions through sustained damage to national infrastructure and weaken fundamental factors such as economic growth, employment, and inflation. This could have implications for the market price of sovereign debt for those countries most susceptible to the physical impacts of climate change.”Footnote 1 Furthermore, rating agencies such as Moody’s (2016) have started incorporating the credit implications of climate change for sovereign issuers.Footnote 2 These developments matter, as sovereign creditworthiness and associated bond costs are crucial for all governments. Rising borrowing costs compensate bondholders for higher risks, but can also push countries into crisis and default. Even in the absence of debt crises, any unit of currency that is spent on borrowing costs can no longer be used for other expenditures such as adaptions to climate change. Therefore, I extend the literature on climate risks, in the form of temperature fluctuations, in connection with financial markets, in the form of sovereign bond returns. Fig. 1 illustrates the main idea of my empirical approach. It depicts the mean annual temperature of the 54 countries in my panel from 1901 to 2018, showing an upward trend since the second half of the twentieth century. The red line shows the constant temperature average from 1901 to 1950. From 1994 onward, which is the start of my estimation period and the shaded area in the graph, I calculate a country’s temperature deviation from its 1901–1950 average. This temperature anomaly variable has a mean of 0.84\(^{\circ }\)C, which is close to the global heating trend of 1\(^{\circ }\)C estimated by the IPCC (2018). Source: Climatic Research Unit Average annual temperature of panel countries (54 emerging economies) from 1901 to 2018 and overall 1901–1950 temperature average. In my estimation, I follow the “new approach” outlined by Dell et al. (2014). Using monthly data for 54 emerging economies from 1994 to 2018, I regress market returns of the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI), a common measure for sovereign debt performance, on the described temperature anomaly fluctuations. I control for precipitation and include country and region-time fixed effects on the month-year level. The captured temperature shocks are thus idiosyncratic and account for weather trends common to each region. Building on a rich literature that links temperature increases to lower GDP growth in poorer and warmer countries (Burke et al. 2015; Dell et al. 2012), reduced firm productivity and output (Zhang et al. 2018; Adhvaryuy et al. 2019), decreasing labor supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014) and more interpersonal and civil conflict (Hsiang et al. 2013), I empirically test the hypothesis if rising temperatures compared to a country’s historical temperature average lead to lower sovereign debt performance (i.e., increasing sovereign risk). My results indicate that the effect of rising temperature anomalies on sovereign creditworthiness critically hinges on a country’s economic and climatic profile: warm countries are significantly more susceptible to temperature shocks than cold or mild-tempered countries, which is line with the results of Burke et al. (2015). For countries with very high average annual temperatures (> 25\(^{\circ }\)C), a 1\(^{\circ }\)C increase in monthly temperature compared to a country’s historical average lowers EMBI returns by 0.464 percentage points on average. This effect corresponds to 11.9% of the EMBI returns’ overall standard deviation. Thus, in a 2\(^{\circ }\)C global heating scenario, EMBI returns (in percentage points) could be lowered for affected countries by roughly a quarter of their overall standard deviation. This magnitude is non-negligible and could lead to rising sovereign borrowing costs or even defaults for warmer countries in the next decades. Such out-of-sample projections must of course be treated carefully, as they abstain from countries’ adaption strategies towards climate change but also from potentially non-linearly aggravating weather effects that are entailed by continuously rising temperatures (see Bolton et al. (2020)). However, if the past temperature anomaly shocks captured in this paper are any guidance, warm countries could bear a major burden from future temperature increases in the form of lower sovereign creditworthiness. Following the analysis of a country’s climatic profile, I test if different economic sector specializations could be related to the strength of temperature shocks on sovereign debt performance. To this end, I interact the temperature anomaly measure with the specialization of a country in terms of agriculture, manufacturing, services or natural resources. However, these specifications do not yield any statistical patterns indicating that countries with higher agricultural shares on GDP, more service sector employees or larger rents from natural resources such as oil are more (or less) susceptible to temperature shocks with respect to their sovereign risk. My results do not rule out that potentially stranded industries, such as fossil fuels, may affect sovereign debt prices in the future. Still, the effect seems to be weak during my estimation period or not connected to temperature shocks. What instead holds remarkably well throughout the analysis is the conditioning impact of institutional quality on temperature-induced sovereign risk. Countries with weaker rule of law, control of corruption, civil rights, democratic governments or less progressive tax systems face a statistically significantly stronger marginal effect of temperature increases that is detrimental to their sovereign creditworthiness. Next to these more traditional institutional variables, climate-related metrics yield a similar conclusion: countries with lower values in the Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index (ND-Gain), which measures both the adaptiveness and vulnerability of a country towards climate change, face significantly higher temperature shock effects on their sovereign risk level. Disentangling the ND-Gain index reveals that this effect is driven more by the adaptive readiness than the vulnerability part of the index. In line with the recommendations of the IPCC (2018), these results suggest that higher overall institutional quality, both traditional and climate-related, could improve the resilience and adaptiveness of emerging economies towards climate change. I also find evidence that poorer countries suffer more from temperature shocks. However, these factors are correlated as poorer countries tend to have worse institutions. In addition, it is difficult to disentangle the long-run effects of climate zones on the creation of institutions or the wealth of nations (see Acemoglu et al. (2002) for a discussion). I shed some light on these interrelations by combining all relevant channels, i.e., warmness, poverty and institutional quality, in one regression. My evidence suggests that the effect of poorer countries suffering stronger from temperature shocks is indeed driven by these countries’ tendencies to have worse institutions. However, both the institutional and the warmness channel remain statistically significant in the same specification, suggesting that stronger institutions can provide resilience towards temperature shocks, independent of the warmness of a country. I conduct encompassing robustness tests to demonstrate the stability of my results. These procedures include changing the fixed effects specification and dependent variable of the baseline. I also drop certain countries from the analysis, firstly if they have few EMBI data points, secondly if their landmass is among the ten largest countries, thirdly if they experienced episodes of political instability. Further tests in Additional file 1 are on the lag structure, the historical average period of temperature shocks as well as different clustering and stationarity tests. The main results stay intact. Lastly, I analyze potential underlying channels of the temperature–sovereign risk relationship. First, I provide evidence that heat-related natural disasters, such as droughts or wildfires, have stronger impact in harming the economic performance of the warmest countries. This finding provides an indication why warm countries are more susceptible to higher temperatures and is a promising avenue for future research. Second, I test if the temperature effects changed after the Paris Agreement in December 2015, which does not seem to be the case. Though any further disentanglement of these channels is beyond the scope of this paper, what matters for the policy implications is the finding that countries with warmer weather and lower institutional quality have so far been hit significantly harder by temperature anomaly shocks with respect to their sovereign creditworthiness. This result is an important extension to the still young literature on climate risks and financial markets. If past trends are any guidance, affected countries could face meaningful increases in their sovereign debt costs or even debt crises as climate change intensifies. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides a framework on how to think about physical climate change risk and its relationship to sovereign risk. Section 3 introduces the data and provides summary statistics. Section 4 describes the empirical framework and main regression results. Section 5 investigates the climatic and economic profiles of countries and their relationship to temperature-induced sovereign risk. The subsequent Sect. 6 provides encompassing robustness checks. I test for possible underlying mechanisms of temperature shocks in Sect. 7. Section 8 concludes.",1

A case study of Kathmandu using a choice-based conjoint experiment,December 2022,Tulsi Ram Aryal,Masaru Ichihashi,Shinji Kaneko,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Kathmandu Valley belongs to Bagmati Province and extends into three administrative districts of Nepal, namely, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur, with a total area of 899 sq km (Fig. 1). The three districts have two metropolitan areas, the metropolitan city of Kathmandu and the metropolitan city of Lalitpur, and 16 municipalities. Kathmandu is the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and is the country’s most important political, administrative, educational, cultural, and commercial center. In the 2011 census year, the total population of the Kathmandu Valley was 2,517,023, with an annual growth rate of 4.63%. This represents 9.32% of the country’s total population, in just 0.49% of the country’s area. The Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal predicts that the population of the Kathmandu Valley will reach four million by 2035 (CBS 2018; JICA 2017). Kathmandu valley and ring road covered area. (Source) Bhattarai et al (2019) The road transport system provides the main mode of mobility in Nepal. Rapid urbanization and increasing economic activities in cities have dramatically increased the demand for vehicles in urban areas. Due to ineffective public transport services, people are attracted to private vehicles, and the number of private vehicles is increasing rapidly compared to that of public vehicles. In the last 15 years, the number of motorbikes and low-occupancy modes of public transport, that is, minibusses and microbuses increased rapidly. Although the government has invested in the expansion of roads in the city of Kathmandu, the increasing number of private vehicles means that the traffic situation remains unchanged. This shows that expanding the road alone is not a sustainable solution for improving public transport. Considering the geographic area and the distance of the city from business and official areas, it is necessary to offer reliable public transport and nonmotorized transport even in cities such as Kathmandu. The Kathmandu Valley is completely dominated by motorbikes, which constitute 79.1% of the total fleet, followed by private vehicles (cars, vans, and jeeps) at 12.42%, heavy-duty vehicles at 4%, and public transport vehicles at 2.67%, and others, with an overall annual growth rate of 14% (DOTM 2019). The share of low-occupancy vehicles, that is, minibusses and microbuses, represents 94% of all public transport vehicles, and large buses make up only 6% (JICA 2017). For the past decade, the road transport service in the Kathmandu Valley has been affected by insufficient road length, narrow and busy roads, unattended traffic, poor traffic management infrastructure, a mix of old and new vehicles, and a multimodal public transport system. Kathmandu Valley faces an unprecedented level of traffic congestion, frequent vehicular accidents, and an increasingly unreliable public transit system (Bhattarai et al. 2019). The quality of service of the current public transport system in Kathmandu is poor, and public transport involves more travel time than private modes of travel. A mass rapid transit (MRT) system should be implemented to reduce congestion, decrease fossil energy consumption, and decrease air pollution (Dhakal 2006; JICA 2017; KSUTP 2014, 2016; MoUD 2017; IBN 2017, Bajracharya and Shrestha 2017; ICIMOD 2017). The current public transport system in the Kathmandu Valley is complex, and the quality of service is poor (World Bank 2019). Due to its bowel-shaped geography, gusty winds rarely remove vehicular emissions from the urban atmosphere, making Kathmandu one of Asia’s most polluted cities, the 100th city on the global pollution index (Bhattarai et al. 2019). Transport is the most important social and environmental issue in the world (Kingham et al. 2001). Transport is the infrastructure of infrastructures (Pokharel and Acharya 2015) and is considered fundamental for urban development. The government of Nepal has prioritized the development of the transport sector. The main objective of the “National Transport Policy is to develop a reliable, cost-effective, safe, facility-oriented and sustainable transport system that promotes and sustains the economic, social, cultural and tourism development of Nepal as a whole” (National Transport Policy 2001). Chen and Chai (2011), using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the concept of habit, studies the intentions of commuters to switch to public transit in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, and finds that the habitual behavior of private vehicle users obstructs a commuter scheme to switch from private vehicles to public transit. JICA (2017) recommends the appropriate timing for the commencement of MRT system operation in Kathmandu, based on the introduction of mass transit systems in 24 Asian megacities and related to the gross income and population of the city. In each of these cases, the first MRT operation is launched when the respective city’s gross product is $3 to $30 billion. In the Kathmandu Valley, the population is projected to be four million, and per capita GDP will exceed US$ 900 by 2030. Thus, “based on experience in other Asian megacities, it shall be appropriate to introduce the 1st MRT system in the Kathmandu Valley between 2020 and 2030” (JICA 2017, p. 122). Shrestha et al. (2013) finds that increasing vehicle speeds would reduce vehicle emissions, and that increasing urban mobility would improve the overall quality of life in the Kathmandu Valley. Das et al. (2018) states that technological change may play an important role in minimizing vehicular air pollution in Kathmandu. Ashalatha et al. (2013), applying multinomial logistics (MNL), finds various factors affecting particular modes of transport. In a case study in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, India, the main reason for shifting from buses to two-wheelers or cars is that the bus transport service is inefficient and unreliable. Jain et al. (2014) identifies reliability, comfort, safety, and cost as the main criteria for the modal shift from private vehicles to public transport, with Delhi as a case study. Using the pairwise weighing method (analytical hierarchy process), they find that safety is the most important criterion (36%), followed by reliability (27%), cost (21%), and comfort (16%). Lin and Guo (2015) studies the utility and weight of factors related to bus transit service quality in Nanjing, China, by applying conjoint analysis. The private sector is responsible for almost 99% of the investment in public transport services in Nepal. There is no integrated policy for the management of public transport services. Government regulations and monitoring capacities are weak. Along with reducing the attraction of private vehicles, encouraging nonmotorized transportation and the use of public transport is an urgent agenda item for sustainable urban mobility. The solution to Kathmandu’s air pollution can be achieved only when the government takes the leading role in addressing the situation (Saud and Paudel 2018). For the effective implementation of such an intervention, it is best to know users’ preferences. This study examines the main attributes affecting commuters in the modal shift to public transport service in Kathmandu. Mass transit systems help to connect communities, support local economies, and improve the living standards of disadvantaged individuals. Therefore, a wide range of studies has been conducted in the field of public transport around the world. Researchers are constantly studying ways to improve public transport. They have focused mainly on the infrastructure sector, the behavioral sector, and the psychological sector. The current study is designed to understand the preferences of Kathmandu Valley commuters regarding the modern transport system before implementing future public transport policy, through a case study that provides a unique opportunity to investigate people’s perceptions of potential new services and their willingness to implement them. The main objective of the choice-based conjoint experiment in this research is to examine the attributes affecting the choices and behaviors of commuters for improved public transport services in Kathmandu by answering the following questions: What factors are associated with commuters’ adoption of an improved public transport service?; Which attributes of the public transport service cause a modal shift?; How does each attribute affect the probability of various preferences?; What is the interaction with the passenger and the causal effect of the attribute? To answer these questions, we have generated attributes of hypothetical improved public transport services that have numerous external impacts on the surrounding environment.",

Thus, it has created different opportunities for diverse economies to be immersed in the Global Value Chains (GVCs). One of these opportunities is present in the manufacturing sector, specifically in the transport equipment industry, due to the rapid acceleration in the automobile sector, their capacity for re-allocation and the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. Due to this transformation, a simple analysis of final imports and exports is no longer sufficient to evaluate an economy’s strengths and weaknesses. This type of analysis limits itself by not being able to detect how many economies were related by transforming the final product and due to the challenges of collecting data about the value-added for different products, very few organizations and studies have addressed this phenomenon. Fortunately, network analysis is an efficient tool to represent and examine different systems and their interdependency. The approach has been used widely in various fields, including neuroscience (Strogatz 2001), biology (Buchanan et al. 2010; Leyeghifard et al. 2017), environment (Kagawa et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2018; Chai et al. 2011), and to less extent, in economics (Brailly 2016; Kitsak et al. 2010). Barabási (2016) defines a network as a “catalog of a system’s components often called nodes or vertices and the direct interactions between them call links or edges.” As Amador and Cabral (2016) suggest, networks suppose the interdependence of observable [and non-observable] data and inspect the influence of connections instead of being treated as isolated agents. In addition, the importance of network analysis relies on the study of relations in a structural form; that is, it considers the effects of a third party on the relationship of i and j, and how this can influence others. In the context of trade, Synder and Kick (1979) are one of the early studies using network analysis. They examine the world system theory in line of the center and periphery during the 1980s; however, the conceptualization of the rise of globalization cannot be explained. In a recent study, Kali et al. (2013) considered a country’s specialization patterns to unwrap the trade network system, finding that density and proximity are relevant variables for a country to move to higher-income products; therefore, higher growth rates. Noguera et al. (2016) applied a traditional input–output (IO) and network analysis, concluding that many economic sectors are related because they present similar characteristics in all countries. They concluded that development level implies an increasing concentration of economic activity in more and better-connected sectors. Gala et al. (2018) pointed out that countries at the core tend to specialize in producing and exporting goods with high value-added (complex goods), being those countries in their majority high-income countries, while the periphery consists in low-income countries and with low technology and complexity products. More recently, Gould et al. (2018) found that the main channels to determine growth in the trade networks are the FDI flows, migration, and the internet from a multidimensional connectivity perspective. Zhou (2020), analyzing the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) effects, suggested that two trading partner countries located in the center of the network and with an RTA have a more significant trade level than those in the periphery. Vidya and Prabheesh (2020), in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, concluded that emerging Asian economies, such as China and India, have taken the lead roles in the world trade networks. Therefore, network analysis can be applied in the GVCs context to examine the structure, connectivity and dependence, the countries participating in, and their dominance, a different perspective from the world system theory, which focuses only on identifying the core and periphery without analyzing the interdependency among members. In that sense, Amador and Cabral (2016), using the World Input–Output Database, analyzed the evolution of the degree centrality in a weighted directed network. They concluded that more countries are joining the GVC as the density of the different networks increases within years. Moreover, Cerina et al. (2015) explore the GVC’s interconnectivity of industries and their flows at the global, regional, and local levels. Their findings are that industries are asymmetrically connected at the global level, which causes shocks to lead to fluctuation in the whole network, concluding that inter-relationships of industries identified at the cross-sectional country level are still at a regional level. With a database from BACI-CEPII (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce International-Centre d'Etudes Prospectives d'Informations Internationales), De Benedictis et al. (2013) uses centrality measures in a local and global sense to differentiate countries’ position in the general trade network as well in commodities such as Bananas, Cement, Movies, Oil, Footwear and Engines, concluding that the network for selected products is characterized by oligopolistic structure. More recently, Cingolani et al. (2017) used the electronic sector, motor vehicles, textiles, and apparel between 2007 and 2014, examining the effect of countries’ neighborhoods and the effect of third countries, allowing to detect clusters and hubs in the networks. However, although the network concept has existed in the trade literature, its use has been limited in the field of the GVC. This delay is mainly because GVC literature focuses on how these value chains are formed, such as the snake and spider shapes (World Bank, Global Value Chain Development Report 2017), and not on the structure itself, its connectivity, and dependency relationships. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish that the shape is not the same as the structure, and this is where the compatibility between the value-added flows on the GVC and the Network Science exists. Based on the paper of Cingolani et al. (2017) and having as a primary reference the study of De Benedictis et al. (2013) and Cerina et al. (2015), I aim to go further with the network analysis. It is essential to highlight that these studies only provided the topological approach (structure) and the measure approaches, such as degree, density, and centralities. Because of this limitation, I would like to use a community detection algorithm, a frequently used tool in network science, to provide an extended version of interpreting and understanding the network structure. The reason to use this tool is that, contrary to the shape of the GVC that classifies a country according to the production stage, the network community uses link density and centralities to classify them. The concept goes beyond grouping countries by their location. Instead, it groups them by the interconnectivity and the effect of third parties on the country i and j relationship. It is important because it classifies countries according to their structural position in the network, revealing hierarchical organization inside the community and the closest interdependency among the members. Its use is applied primarily in computational sciences, such as Lu et al. (2018), Yang and Le (2021), Yang et al. (2013), in biology, Vandeputte et al. (2017), or social science, Šubelj et al. (2016). This study distinguishes transport equipment from others as, for the industry, core regions have been distinguished by different markets from the final demand, but not the inter-relations between the economies by the value-added contribution, except for Pavlínek (2021), who conducted an analysis for the automotive industry in the Eurozone. In addition, the industry is one of the manufacturing industries that capture more presence of Research and Development (R&D), management, and complex activities based on the labor market; all of them are essential characteristics in the GVC studies. The transport equipment industry has peculiar characteristics to be considered a highly complex value chain. The industry is characterized as a mature industry that offers high-level products. Moreover, the value chain presents different degrees of fragmentation and technological capacities. That is, multinational companies (MNCs) seek places with the lower cost of the different stages of production. At the same time, in the main branch, they focus on developing the new technology to be added to the product. In other words, the industry added technical innovations to the existing products rather than developing new ones. Schwabe (2020) provides a study focusing on German suppliers’ risks and strategies with the transition from combustion engines to electric engines in the transport equipment industry. He mentioned that lead firms tend to reallocate their production process close to the assembly lines due to the increased cost. On a more disaggregated level, Fana and Villani (2022) decompose the automotive supply chain by analyzing the employment, the value-added, and the occupation structure for countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. They found that after the global financial crisis, the supply chains reorganized, being the Eastern Europe countries the ones who benefitted the more due to the strong position of Germany in the industry. Moreover, they emphasize that German car makers offshored the production of the intermediate components, kept the final assembly domestic, and dominated activities such as R&D. Grodzicki and Skrzypek (2020) found similar results using a panel-data ARDL model, concluding that Germany’s strong position in the GVCs is because the country can maintain high value-added inputs in its final goods. In contrast, Spain relies more on foreign suppliers. Dussel Peters (2022) studied the relationship between the United States, China, and Latin America in the global auto parts chain. He highlights that China is gradually taking the place of Canada in the intra-NAFTA relationships as a result of its local production policy and exports oriented after joining the World Trade Organization. Moreover, he states that Mexico has benefited from the preferential tariffs originated from the agreement and from the recent forced local content in the automobile industry that the USMCA agreement demands. Nevertheless, the main limitation of this study is that even if it tries to explain the triangular relationship, it does from the aggregate value and not the value-added flows perspective. From a geographical and knowledge creation perspective, Rodríguez-De la Fuente and Lampón (2020) studied the cases of the Mexican and Spain transport industries, mainly the automobile, which is the most representative of the industry. They concluded that the status of Mexico on the GVCs is characterized by a low added value and knowledge contents of production activities and cannot generate technology, and its value-added is mainly due to the North America Automobile production system. On the other side, Spain’s position is characterized by adding value and knowledge to the production activity; however, it is still in an intermediate position due to its dependency on the European production system. Crossa and Ebner (2020) got similar results for the Mexico case and Sancak (2021) for Mexican and Turkish suppliers. The study by Lee et al. (2021) focuses on the automobile sector of China, Thailand, and Malaysia and compares their cases with the success of South Korea. They concluded that the success case of the upgrading case of China is due to the increase of the share of domestic value-added in their exports, labor productivity, and substantial investment in R&D. On the other hand, Thailand has focused on increasing their exports. However, the value-added content is from MNCs, mainly from Japan; as a result, Thailand has just the connector role in the industry. Finally, Malaysia still needs to increase its role in the GVCs due to the lack of competitiveness in the local markets; thus, the few existing local firms do not add value to their products nor focus on the exports side. Nevertheless, none of the previous studies has conducted a global performance of the transport equipment industry, nor have they used the network approach to explain this phenomenon. To fill the gap in the GVC literature, this research aims to unravel the particular characteristics of the contribution of the value-added in the transport equipment industry network by addressing the following questions: Is the transport equipment industry highly centralized from the value-added flows? Which countries are part of the center and which are still far from joining the industry? How can we measure the relevance of each country in the network? Do communities exist in the industry, and what are their specific characteristics? Are they part of the same territory? To answer the above questions, I used the UNCTAD-Eora Global Value Chain database, which contains information on the in- and out-flows of value-added of the industry, and this information is computed as a complex network system where countries are represented as nodes and value-added flows as edges. One of the main contributions of this paper is that it analyzes the industry as a whole structure and provides information on the integration process in this network not only by region, but also identifying the leading economies that influence the movement of flows through their interactions. Moreover, by applying the various measures and answering the previous questions, the study clarifies the mixed results in the adopted policies that each country and regions have and how in/dependent on the production process they are. These measures confirm the existence of different governance structures in the industry across countries and regions that are attributable beyond a geographical factor. Finally, it contributes by expanding the use of the Network measures in the economic field related to the GVC studies. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides information about Data and the methodology. In Sect. 3, the main questions for this study are driven and provide the network analysis results, divided into four different approaches: the first approach consists of visual tools, the second approach applies measure tools, such as degree, clustering, density, which will reflect those countries with high out-degree dominate the supply of value-added in the industry, while high in-degree countries are the users. The third approach uses the centrality concept split into two major components, Eigen betweenness and Eigenvector centrality measures; they provide valuable information about the position of each country and its role in the industry. Finally, detecting communities, the fourth and last approach, provides information on highly related countries by grouping them according to the in–out-flows density. Section 4 concludes.",
11.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,05 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-022-00290-8,Revisiting the electricity consumption-led growth hypothesis: is the rule defied in France?,December 2022,Abdulkadir Abdulrashid Rafindadi,Isah Buhari Aliyu,Ojonugwa Usman,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the contemporary era, economies that are heavily reliant on international trade and strive for a certain level of economic growth are more vulnerable to the possibility of experiencing severe economic shocks, which slows economic progress (see Irwin and Terviö 2002; Frankel et al. 1996; Frankel and Romer 1999; Schneider 2005). The financial crisis of 2008–2009 alone has had a considerable impact on the majority of developed and emerging countries, wreaking havoc on export-dependent economies (Tang et al., 2015). Following the seminal work of Kraft and Kraft (1978), empirical studies identified a substantial link between energy consumption and economic growth that is far greater than what is predicted from international trade (see Al-mulali et al. 2014; Al-Mulali 2014; Al-mulali and Ozturk 2014; Wolde-Rufael and Menyah 2010; Mehrpooya et al. 2018; Ansong et al. 2017; Heuër 2017; Dos Santos et al. 2016; Afkhami et al. 2015; Kolhe et al. 2015; Alola et al. 2019; Usman et al. 2020, 2021). Electricity is a necessary component of today's productive environment because there has never been a viable substitute for energy consumption that might facilitate production activities for domestic consumption or export in any given economic system (Rafindadi 2015a and b; Usman, 2022). Electricity energy, as a necessary and indispensable factor, permits the attainment of efficient and effective economic productivity, since the essentiality of energy consumption is correlated with the important factors of production, namely land, labour, and capital (Rafindadi 2016). The presence of efficient, sustainable, and sufficient electricity energy consumption in any country indicates the possibility of an increase in the country's GDP and vice versa (Adom 2011; Rafindadi and Ozturk, 2016; Rafindadi and Usman 2021). According to Wolde-Rufael 2004; Halicioglu (2009), Al-mulali et al. (2014), and Al-Mulali (2014), achieving production optimality requires a direct link and interaction between energy sufficiency and energy efficiency. Any apparent increase in economic growth is essentially necessary by the possibility of increasing energy consumption; and therefore, established efficient and sufficient energy consumption in a country implies the existence of a fully productive economic system, which is synonymous with growth. Recently, France is one advanced country that provides interesting case study for the role of electricity consumption in economic prosperity. In 2019, France is the seventh largest economy in the world and the third largest in Europe (IMF 2020). The country ranks second in the world in terms of nuclear energy production, after only the United States. France generates around 76% of its electricity from fully operational nuclear power reactors, with the remainder coming from renewable and fossil energy sources, respectively. In 2019, the country generated about 379.5 TWh and consumed only 432 TWh. The total electricity production was about 537.7 TWh with the nuclear share having about 71.67%, the world’s highest percentage. Furthermore, about 70 TWh of France electricity is being exported to the Europe net each year. Hence, by the first half of 2021, France became the largest electricity exporter to Europe, particularly to the UK and Italy (Trade Economics, 2022). As a result of this feat, France became the world's third greatest power exporter. For example, France earned about 633 million Euro in June 2022 and increased to 824 million Euro in July 2022 (Trade Economics, 2022). In a similar trend, the OECD report in 2019 demonstrated that since 2013, a growing tension has hampered the French economy's ability to grow at a reasonable rate. In light of the recent economic recession's massive impact on the economies of the majority of European countries, including Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, as well as other parts of the world, it is likely that France’s economy will be one of the most affected in the event of a future global economic downturn, owing largely to its non-presidential status (IMF 2020). The question we asked here is why, despite France’s consistent electrical supply, GDP continues to fluctuate? Has power consumption in the country ceased to have significant contributing impacts, as originally argued by Kraft and Kraft (1978) and more recently by Al-mulali et al. (2014); Almulali (2014); Al-mulali and Ozturk (2014); Apinran et al. (2022) and Hassan et al. (2022)? The purpose of this study is to determine whether electricity usage is consistent with the advanced economy like France's economic growth prospects. The study specifically examines the extent to which electricity consumption contributes to the economic growth prospects of France, if at all. To distinguish this study from others, a comparative multivariate strategy was used, in which factors pertaining to France’s financial development, capital–labour ratio, and trade openness were included in the line of analysis. The remaining sections of this work are organised in four sections. Section 2 covers the relevant (empirical) literature in the topic, whereas Sect. 3 discusses the methods used in the study. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings from the various analyses undertaken in this study. Section 5 presents the study’s conclusion and policy implications.",3
11.0,1.0,Journal of Economic Structures,23 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40008-022-00280-w,Increasing returns and business cycles in a family of Goodwinian models with Leontiev technology,December 2022,Alexander V. Ryzhenkov,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Marxist theory of extended capitalist reproduction together with the advanced system dynamics methodology presented in Rahmandad et al. (2015) provides theoretical guidelines for the research, maintained by the mathematical bifurcation theory stated in Kuznetsov (1998) as well. The development of the Marxist theory necessitates a continuation of polemics with the “neoclassical” conceptions. The scientific term industrial cycle is the close substitute for the common term business cycle. Industrial cycles are based on the turn-over of industrial capital as the unity of productive capital and capital of circulation in industry, agriculture and other sectors. This paper is focused on the productive capital in a closed economy placing capital of circulation, governmental activity and ecological aspects outside the explicit consideration. The industrial cycles are middle-term cycles with oscillations of investments into fixed production assets (commonly named after Clément Juglar) with typical duration roughly between 5 and 12 years. They are characterized not only by regular fluctuations of the positive growth rate of investment, employment, net output and some other indicators but also by decline of these indicators in crises. Albert Einstein once noticed: “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler”. The main purpose of this paper is to present a family of tutorial Goodwinian (essentially Marxist) models of capital accumulation through industrial cycles that are less complicated than the author’s Marxist models of the extended capitalist reproduction in the USA previously published in Ryzhenkov (2009, 2018) among other publications on the same subject matter. This simplification (universalization) still does not go excessively far in order to achieve the main and related purposes of this research. This avoids, in particular, substitution of output-capital ratio for employment ratio (or vice versa) that may be justified in other inquiries into increasing returns and business cycles. The proposed tutorial models of increasing returns and industrial cycles uncover substantial generic structures of capital accumulation with a help of stock-and-flow diagrams and feedback sequencing (similar in certain aspects to nucleotide sequencing in microbiology). Still they do not reflect endogenous quasi-logistic supply of labour force, disregards employment ratio as an immediate factor of growth rate of capital intensity, do not apply discontinuity of the first kind in the equations for growth rates of real wage and capital intensity, discount discontinuity of the second kind in partial derivatives of technical progress and investment functions. Instead of combination of extended Kalman filtering with maximum likelihood in the probabilistic setting within more realistic models, the tutorial models assume on the current stage a purely deterministic form, abstracting from observation errors and stochastic elements in the equations of motion. The experience of lecturing confirms that reasonable simplifications at the proper stages of education empower learning and stimulate new steps by students themselves. The studied original models are a convincing alternative to real business cycle models developed within the framework of the “neoclassical” concept of general economic equilibrium. They can also replace the model of cyclical fluctuations from Samuelson (1939a, b), which is undeservedly rooted in macroeconomics courses at universities, as logically contradictory and inconsistent with the facts. Models of the real business cycle, as well as the superficial models of the multiplier accelerator in Samuelson (1939a, b), mostly ignore the indisputable fact that the extraction of monopoly profits increases inequality in the primary distribution of national income between classes and restrains the increase in investment necessary to solve socio-economic and geopolitical tasks. The recent Economic Report of the President (2022) reviews these and other relevant aspects (avoiding the very notion of the state-monopoly capitalism and research on the subject matter in the prolific Marxist literature). The report’s inference that strengthening monopoly power promotes profits and sharpens inequality in primary distribution of national income corresponds to proposed elucidation of the same conclusion in the present paper. Names of models (Z-1, L-2, etc.) are used through the text exclusively for brevity. The given explanations help to avoid confusing and ambiguity. A model denoted as Z-1 in Ryzhenkov (2016) has been developed as a dialectical negation of the “neoclassical” models in Ploeg (1985) and Aguiar-Conraria (2008) that, although having contributed to understanding of growth cycles, have implicitly claimed business cycles and Marx accumulation theory dead. Marx’ theory, immensely supported by stubborn and too often inconvenient facts, helped reveal the greed feedback loops, as well as the destabilizing cooperation and stabilizing competition of investors in Z-1. In Z-1, as a system of three ODEs, the rate of capital accumulation has become the new phase variable. Targeted long-term increase of the stationary rate of capital accumulation reduces stationary profit rate together with raising stationary relative wage. Here and below ODE briefly stands for an ordinary differential equation. Oscillations imitating industrial cycles are endogenous. A crisis is a manifestation of relative and absolute over-accumulation of capital. A supercritical Andronov–Hopf bifurcation (see, particularly, Gandolfo 2010; Fanti and Manfredi 1998; Kuznetsov 1998), abbreviated as AHB through this paper, unleashes limit cycle with a period of about 6 years.Footnote 1 The subordinate purpose of this paper is to advance refinement from the standard “neoclassical” assumptions that distort the generic structures determining perpetual disequilibrium in capital accumulation. The listing of what the prototypical model Z-1 denies so far is the following: centrality of “perfect competition” with general economic equilibrium, profit maximization equating wage with imaginary marginal labour productivity, balanced growth path related to stationary (locally or even globally) equilibrium and “pendulum with friction” analogy for a capitalist economy experiencing business cycles. Now it is the turn for a liberating of the Goodwinian models from the efficiency wage hypothesis, underlying production function with constant elasticity of factors substitution, in Arrow et al. (1961). The divergence between trends of net total economic productivity and hourly pay for the typical worker in the USA since the end of 1970s up to 2020 is emphasized in the section Labour Market Inequality in Chapter 5 of the Economic Report of the President (2022). Thus, the efficiency wage hypothesis, unsound theoretically, is empirically refuted by this divergence, detrimental for typical workers, in the real life and in statistical data. These data are updated by the Productivity–Pay Tracker of the Economic Policy Institute (see Appendix 4). Boggio (2006) modified a classical model from Goodwin (1972). A constant capital-output ratio was retained. Increasing returns were introduced by means of the Kaldor–Verdoorn empirical law. After the setting of dependence of a growth rate of output per worker on a growth rate of fixed production assets, a non-trivial stationary state in this Boggio’s model (tagged as B-1 in the present paper) becomes unstable. Boggio (2006) did not suggest how stability could be re-established in that model with rather superficial treatment of increasing returns criticized in Ryzhenkov (2009). The reply in Boggio (2010) deserves a further discussion. Section 2 recalls the properties of the famous model of cyclical growth in Goodwin (1972). The addition of the scale effects to this model leads to negation of the conservative fluctuations substituted by either explosive long waves or by monotonous departure from an economic area. Under reasonable parameters’ magnitudes a neutral centre–unstable focus bifurcation takes place. The notion of increasing returns (economy of scale) is reconsidered as a manifestation of reinforcing direct and roundabout scale effects built into feedback loops of different order and polarity. Section 2 utilizes definitions of increasing returns proposed in Ryzhenkov (2009) that distinguish between (type I) and type II: the growth rate of output per worker depends positively on the employment ratio or, correspondingly, on the growth rate of this ratio. This section extends these definitions: the growth rate of output per worker depends negatively on the capital-output ratio (type I m) or, correspondingly, on the growth rate of this ratio (type II m). The technical progress function proposed reflects the essence of Kaldor’s idea on technical progress embodied in fixed production assets per labourer. The growth rate of the latter is the factor of the growth rate of output per worker. This growth rate depends positively additionally on the growth rate of employment ratio that accounts for the increasing returns of type II. This technical progress function refines and generalizes the scale effect contained in the Kaldor–Verdoorn empirical law of increasing returns refining the initially given form of B-1. Two-dimensional Goodwinian model B-1 in the refined form contains feedback loops that either reinforce or weaken direct economy of scale (type II). Gains in unit value of labour power are mostly detrimental for technological progress. In result, B-1 in its both initial and refined forms generates explosive dynamics that are not contained in the economic area. Section 3 grasps three-dimensional Goodwinian model with Leontiev technology L-1. Monopoly capital implements proportional and derivative control over the capital accumulation rate that becomes a third phase variable in addition to the relative wage (unit value of labour power) and the employment ratio. An unstable focus in L-1 is qualitatively similar to an unstable focus in B-1; diverging fluctuations leave the economic space in both although the fluctuations differ in frequency and amplitude. Unlike B-1, L-1 is able to generate growth cycles contained in the economic space. These cycles have typically lower relative variation of main indicators than industrial cycles. L-1, containing the greed feedback loops, reflects destabilizing cooperation and stabilizing competition of investors. This model is the refined case of Z-1 freed from the efficiency wage hypothesis. This refinement is achieved at cost: unlike the “mother” model Z-1, the “daughter” possesses a constant capital-output ratio—consequently, the industrial cycles are not generated anymore and typically only growth cycles run. This limitation requires the augmentation of L-1 by an alternative hypothesis on a partial dynamic law governing the capital-output ratio in Sect. 4. A reasonable mechanization (automation) function reflects technical progress induced by production relations in L-2. The unit value of labour power and variable capital-output ratio endogenously co-determine the growth rate of capital intensity thereby. Section 4 develops L-1 into four-dimensional model of industrial cycles L-2. This model is presented as unity of Phillips Eq. (7), technical progress function (23), mechanization (automation) function (37) and capital accumulation rate function (41). The logistic component in (41) plays a significant role in the cyclical pattern with core asymmetry in movements of the partial derivative of net change of accumulation rate with respect to accumulation rate, laid bare in Appendix 3. It is demonstrated additionally that L-2 matches the macroeconomic regularities known as technical progress induced by production relations, the Kaldor–Verdoorn empirical law and the Okun rule. Equation (40) for a net change of employment ratio in L-2 extends the Okun rule (29) in L-1 by a second term related to a deviation of capital-output ratio from its stationary magnitude. An adjustment parameter’s magnitude at a first term related to a deviation of a growth rate of net output from its stationary growth rate is higher in L-2 than in L-1. Relative over-accumulation of capital and absolute over-accumulation of capital take place in both L-1 and L-2; however, only the latter, containing new pertinent feedback loops, generates declines in net output in acute or moderate crises of industrial cycles. A set of appropriate feedback loops with pertinent loop gains is revealed. A number of feedback loops in L-2 is greater than that in two previous models, the order of some of them is also higher and the gain of a particular feedback loop differs from that in either in B-1 or in L-1. Each of several feedback loops from B-1 and L-1 involving a growth rate of output per worker is transformed into a loop with an opposite polarity because the impact of an increment in a growth rate of fixed production assets on a growth rate of capital intensity turns to the opposite (from positive to negative). Such dialectical “mutations” and emergent properties reflect the evolution of capitalist production relations necessitated and maintained by the technological development that in turn is compelled by these relations within capitalist mode of production. The paper explores how state-monopoly regulation of capital accumulation progresses through changes in the main production relationships. The classes of capitalists and workers learn from experience that greater investment flexibility (as in L-2 against B-1) in reasonable bounds is beneficial for capital accumulation and wealth creation. In the process of learning, the society invents new behavioural competitive-cooperative algorithms that generally foster organizational complexity (through new feedback loops and by reshaping former loops in L-2 in relation to L-1 and B-1). The emphasized changes in socio-economic relations are based on technological progress and reinforced by advance in technology. However, the very evolution of capital accumulation grasped in B-1 through L-2 inevitably brings new sources of instability that can become dominant under certain conditions exposed. The remaining part of this paper is organized in the following way. Appendixes 1, 2 and 3 explain details of the essential properties of B-1, L-1 and L-2. Although balanced growth path is possible in L-2 as in the preceding models, the economy cyclically bounces back and forth.

Since several economies take part in multiple steps before the final goods are completed, production has become a complex system in which firms are involved in highly specialized phases rather than the entire process.Footnote 1 Accordingly, product fragmentation has modified trade operations, which have evolved towards complicated flows of goods transiting between many interconnected countries. The disintegration of production makes it difficult to clearly establish the positions of countries in relation to aspects, such as the efficiency of local production, the prices of domestic goods relative to those of foreign ones, and the strength or vulnerability of external demand. This presents a challenge for identifying the importance of trade to domestic economies, especially if the part played by trade in boosting local incomes and local welfare is to be evaluated. One method of quantifying the consequences of trade for individual economies that has recently received intensive research effort is to calculate the (domestic) value added embodied in exports. In particular, Johnson and Noguera (2012) proposed an accounting measurement for evaluating the value added inserted in trade operations. Koopman et al. (2014) used the inter-country relationships of the input–output (IO) model to identify various value-added components within gross exports. Their framework was later extended by Los et al. (2016), who introduced the input–output hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to clarify the measurements proposed by Koopman et al. (2014). In parallel, Borin and Mancini (2017) further analysed the method of Koopman et al. (2014) to consistently define bilateral trade flows. Los and Timmer (2018), for their part, proposed an extension of the HEM to obtain the value added of gross exports both bilaterally and globally. Wang et al. (2018) distinguished the inter-sectoral backward and forward linkages in the measurement of the value added of exports and generalized the accounting method to sectors of production and pairs of countries. Arto et al. (2019) proposed an evaluation of the value added of exports measured at the border by including all countries and industries that take part in the value-added flows. To further clarify double counting in the measurement of trade flows, Mirodout and Ye (2020) moved the accounting to the sales of foreign affiliates to determine their impact on host economies. More recently, Mirodout and Ye (2021) proposed a framework that can distinguish domestic and foreign value added measured globally, bilaterally, and individually. The present paper falls within this line of literature but, rather than focusing on the (production-related) value added of exports, it evaluates the (labour-related) impacts on employment and factor income. The extent to which gross exports create jobs and expand income domestically, thus helping boost individuals’ welfare, is of particular interest for national authorities. Bearing this idea in mind, this paper can be considered complementary to existing (value-added focused) studies that quantify the importance of trade on domestic economies. At the country level, the proposed method quantifies the additional number of workers and the amount of labour income that should be attributed to export activity. At the global (multi-country) level, it illustrates the distributional mechanisms that operate across countries, especially those related to labour issues. There is a rich vein of literature that analyses the relationship between international trade and employment, both empirically and theoretically, and focuses on specific (partial) issues, such as the relationship between income distribution and wages,Footnote 2 the implications of trade for employment,Footnote 3 the wage and unemployment gaps between skilled and unskilled labour caused by trade,Footnote 4 the impacts of trade liberalization on relative prices and on employment,Footnote 5 and the labour market implications of international fragmentation.Footnote 6 Additionally, numerous papers use a macroeconomic perspective to evaluate the contribution of external markets to creating income, employment, and economic activity within domestic economies. In this line of research, the multi-regional input–output model has demonstrated great explanatory capacity for capturing the interdependence and connections inherent to international trade. In particular, Timmer et al. (2013) constructed a multi-regional IO model of the global value chains of sectors to determine the structure of employment in EU countries. Los et al. (2015b) analysed the impact of foreign demand on employment creation in China by using global input–output methodology. With a similar procedure, Chen et al. (2017) calculated the consequences of Brexit for European Union (EU) regions by quantifying GDP reductions and negative (monetary) impacts on labour income. For EU countries, Arto et al. (2018) featured a series of indicators to detail the employment impacts of international trade by focusing on individual European Union member states, their trading partners, industries, skills, age, and gender. Similarly, Arto et al. (2020) reported indicators to show how final demand in each country of the European Union contributed to EU employment. The present analysis examines the main countries in the world to calculate the macroeconomic impacts of trade on employment. The method employed provides a complementary (global) view to explain the significance of export activity in supporting employment around the world. In particular, it focuses on an accounting perspective based on an inter-country input–output framework to quantify the number of jobs and amount of labour income directly attributed to exports. By considering a portrait of world production, the method fully reflects the global value chains and worldwide propagation mechanisms triggered by trade. Since the proposal includes IO inter-sectoral and inter-country relationships, it illustrates how exports increase sectoral production and how this new production is converted into jobs, thus influencing the domestic demand for labour. It also quantifies the labour income created by a country’s export activity. The method has excellent explanatory capacity in terms of its reliability in capturing the multi-lateral channels of the fragmented value chains, and can be applied empirically using available global input–output databases. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “A global model of employment accounting” defines a global accounting mechanism through which various indicators are derived to measure the number of jobs and the amount of labour income attributed to export activity. Section ""Database"" describes the database and Section ""Employment impacts of gross exports"" shows the empirical results. Finally, Section ""Conclusions"" draws several conclusions.",

Under the influence of globalization and rapid urbanization a lot of changes take place in the urban territorial planning, forms and organizational structure. As a result, a system of urban hierarchy is created in the country regions, consisting of large, average and small cities with different functions, which propels social and economic disparity and differentiation by living standards. The necessity in development of the basis for regional policy and strategies of spatial development has determined the importance of cities research in the present scientific agenda. In order to make efficient and scientifically substantiated managerial decisions it is necessary to understand mechanisms, conditions and factors underlying the cities functioning, which makes the investigation of their interrelatedness in the territorial space of regions and the country on the whole actual. Research hypothesis: In the settlement system of Russia the differentiated spatial effects of the geographically adjacent territories are observed which can serve as indicators at creation of the regional development strategy. The purpose of this research is to evaluate a degree of the cities interrelatedness in the territorial space of Russia.",

For the past few years, the focus on biodiesel has greatly increased due to the reduction in fossil-fuel oil production in Indonesia, crude oil price trends at the global level, and the country's trade deficit in the oil and gas sector. According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) (2021), crude oil production in Indonesia was about 745.14 thousand barrels of oil per day (BOPD) in 2019 and fell to 719.99 BOPD in 2020 (a decline of 3.37%). After experiencing demand and supply shocks due to Covid-19 since 2020, the economic recovery in 2021 increased the price of crude oil to about USD 70 per barrel from about USD 20 per barrel in mid-2020 (World Energy Outlook 2021). Rising global oil prices impact the Indonesian trade balance because the country has become an oil-importing country as there has not been any significant increase in oil sector investment and production capacity. From January 2017 to September 2018, Indonesian oil and gas imports rose 27.14%, resulting in a trade deficit of USD 9.4 billion in the oil and gas sector (MT 2018). In 2019 and 2020, the trade deficits in the sector still amounted to about USD 5.4 billion and USD 9 billion, respectively. Based on these figures, Indonesia is taking a massive risk if it continues to depend on fossil fuels, which have been used excessively and rapidly depleted. The international community's concerns about the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are increasing pressure on governments in many countries, including Indonesia, to develop renewable energy sources. Attention is currently focused on biodiesel since Indonesia has strong production potential in this sector, particularly from palm oil. Indonesia is the largest palm oil producer in the world, contributing about 50% to the total global supply (Sahara et al. 2017). The country increased its palm oil production from 31.07 million tons in 2015 to 42.9 million tons in 2018 (Indonesia Directorate General of Estates 2019). It is predicted to boost its output to 49.71 million tons in 2021 (Ministry of Agriculture 2021). In response to these challenges, i.e., the growing scarcity of fossil fuels, price volatility of fossil fuels, and increasing trade deficit of the oil sector, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) has introduced biodiesel development policies. The mandate also aims to increase the added value of palm oil, stabilize crude palm oil production at the domestic level, and improve farmers' income and rural development. Since its introduction in 2015, the mandate has been implemented primarily in the public service obligation (PSO) category for transportation—which accounts for 90% of national oil use—and electricity generation. Recently, the mandate was extended. The recent B20 blending mandate for all sectors of the economy covers subsidized diesel oil and non-subsidized diesel oil (USDA 2018). The B20 mandate comprises a mix of 20% vegetable oil from crude palm oil and diesel oil to produce biodiesel. The initiative was implemented in September 2018, extending a prior regulation signed in 2016, when B20 applied only to subsidized diesel oil. The GoI also aimed to accelerate the implementation of a B30 mandate to 2019, ahead of its original start date in 2020. The mandate requires the blending composition of biodiesels to include 30% crude palm oil (B30) and 70% diesel oil (Siantar and Nugraha 2018). In 2020, the total production of biodiesel (including the production through the biodiesel program) reached about 8.13 million kiloliters, while consumption amounted to about 9.2 million kiloliters (MEMR 2021). To support the biodiesel program, the GoI provided subsidies by introducing a palm oil export levy, which is collected by a designated public service agency called the Estate Crop Fund for Palm Oil (BPDPKS). These levies will be used to subsidize biodiesel once the diesel oil price index is more economical than the biodiesel price index. As of May 2022, the GoI imposes an export levy of USD 200/metric ton for crude palm oil (Ministry of Finance 2022). The implementation of the B30 mandate faces several challenges. First, the increase in the price of Crude Palm Oil (CPO), particularly in 2021, highlights the sustainability of feedstock for the biodiesel program since it will be more profitable to export crude palm oil than to fulfill the biodiesel program. Second, funding the program has required a large amount of government subsidies. For example, in 2021, GoI subsidies for the mandatory 30% biodiesel (B30) program reached IDR 44 trillion (Wibowo 2021). Third, the heated issue of ""food versus fuel"" indicates that increased biodiesel production may lead to stronger land competition among actors, leading to higher food prices (Kretschmer and Peterson 2010). Fourth, there is the challenge of exporting biodiesel since the United States has implemented anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Indonesian biodiesel. At the same time, the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive Recast (RED II) is likely to cap crop-based biodiesels by 2030. This will reduce the demand from the EU biodiesel industry for palm oil (USDA 2018). Considering these four challenges, it is timely to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the economy-wide impacts of enhanced biodiesel production (B30) on the Indonesian economy at the macro- and micro-levels and on regional growth. This broad scope is essential since biodiesel production impacts not only the palm oil and oil sectors but also other sectors of the economy. As such, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is employed in the study. We have updated the database for the Indonesian CGE by using the latest input–output (I–O) table published by Statistics Indonesia in 2020. To capture the regional impact, we also included the latest interregional input–output (IRIO) published by Statistics Indonesia in 2021. By having the IRIO, the impact of the B30 mandate on regional growth (at a provincial level) can be captured. This paper is organized into five parts, including this introduction. The second section describes the impact of biodiesel development in several countries based on existing literature. The third section provides the main data and methods used in this paper. The fourth section describes the findings, and the fifth consolidates this paper's main conclusions and implications.",2

Agricultural cooperatives are defined as a community of farmers who voluntarily unite to achieve economic and social goals. Therefore, their main purpose is to protect farming and ensure farmers’ sustenance. Nonetheless, the Japanese government evaluates the agricultural industry as being less productive compared to other developed economies, given the influence of JAs on farmers.Footnote 1 Scholars have previously noted the presence of protectionism and interventionism to explain the lower productivity of Japan’s agricultural sector, especially for rice farming. Since the 1970s, the government implemented reductions in the acreage planted for rice to prevent the oversupply of grain and maintain domestic rice prices. JAs were fierce defenders of this policy owing to their vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Moreover, JAs have been firmly against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), claiming that TPP participation would destroy Japanese agriculture. JAs emphasize that inflow of cheap foreign rice, owing to tariff abolition, will make maintaining high rice prices under the current rice acreage reduction policy difficult. Honma and Mulgan (2018) explained that JAs have been recognized as a symbol of “regulations as solid as bedrock” by the government. Therefore, the government has been fervently promoting the organizational reform of the agricultural cooperative system to empower farmers and improve productivity. Specifically, it has attempted removing the function of the Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives, known as JA-Zenchu, a national apex body, to audit local cooperatives and review activities such as farm management, farm product marketing, supply of production inputs, and credit and mutual insurance businesses.Footnote 2 Among these activities, marketing and purchasing are very important in terms of improving the livelihood of member farmers. However, since the number of agricultural workers has been decreasing, JAs cannot continue to depend on farmers. The total number of regular JA members also decreased from 5.33 million in 1998 to 4.24 million in 2018. In contrast, the total number of nonregular members, comprising many non-farmers, drastically increased during the same period: from 3.70 million to 6.24 million individuals. Therefore, nonregular members now outnumber regular members by more than 2 million. Moreover, the gap between regular and nonregular members is becoming wider, especially in urban areas.Footnote 3 Therefore, non-mainstream businesses such as banking and insurance have become indispensable for many JAs, especially those located in urban areas. The ongoing JA reform aims to correct the original role of JAs by considering the overreliance on financial activities as an issue. In Japan, many traditionally organized agricultural cooperatives have been forced to abandon their business forms. Similarly, Fulton and Hueth (2009) found that many agricultural cooperatives in Western economies have undergone profound changes, including their business forms and cooperative principles. However, in Japan, the current excessive dependence on financial business by non-farmers, especially in urban areas, is undoubtedly different from the cooperative principles of JAs. Essentially, a significant disparity in the operations for JAs between urban and rural areas can be found. Thus, this study investigates regional differences in the business characteristics of JAs by estimating multiproduct cost functions as follows. First, we evaluate the disparity in efficiency measures of urban and rural areas by employing a meta-frontier approach based on stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The meta-frontier is considered an “envelope” cost function that encompasses groups of entities operating under different circumstances. We believe no study has hitherto applied these methods to measure the efficiency of agricultural cooperatives. Second, by using the parameters of the meta-frontier estimation results, the overall and product-specific scale economies are computed at the sample mean of urban and rural areas, respectively. Measuring product-specific economies of scale is helpful for understanding the contribution of each product to the cost of JAs. Finally, overall and product-specific scope economies are computed for investigating the potential cost-saving effects of joint production by JAs. Product-specific economies of scope exist when each product has a cost advantage for multiproduct organizations such as JAs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews previous studies on agricultural cooperative institutions. Sections 3 and 4 describe the methodology and data, respectively. Section 5 presents the estimation results. Section 6 summarizes the study’s findings and concludes the paper with policy implications.",1

In addition to human casualties and housing damage, the damaging of products and capital equipment in primary and secondary industries caused outrage and a stagnation of production activities. The subsequent destruction of the supply chain spread the negative impact across the country. The stagnation of production activities decreased corporate surplus and workers’ income and resulted in the reduction of consumer demand and capital formation. Furthermore, anxiety for the future and the reputational damage of the local people due to the earthquakes caused a decline in consumerism and tourism. On the other hand, the active support by the central and local government for the restoration of the infrastructure and the reconstruction of business and personal activities for the local people had an impact on raising consumer demand and capital formation. Thus, the serious damages from the earthquake may have been compensated for by the public expenditure and the people’s efforts to overcome the difficulties they faced. The physical and economic impacts of the earthquake may differ by region. The purpose of this study is to use the multi-regional input–output (MRIO) table to investigate the economic impacts of the earthquake in the regions of the Kumamoto Prefecture and the degree of recovery made by the restoration and reconstruction program. While an input–output analysis on the supply constraint model reflects an estimation of loss due to disasters, such as the Kumamoto earthquake, this study focuses on the demand side, which involves the change of expenditures in the prefecture by “damage” and “reconstruction.” We elucidate these effects on each region in the prefecture. Two databases, “Regional Domestic Expenditure Index” (RDEI) and “Prefectural Accounts,” enable this study to estimate the expenses of “damage” and “reconstruction” by month and the measure change of spending that annually based data does not grasp. We also estimate their positive and negative economic ripple effects using the MRIO table, which consists of three regions in the Kumamoto Prefecture (Kumamoto City, Northern, and Southern prefectures) as well as other parts of Japan. Figure 1 shows the prefecture and its area classification subject to this analysis.Footnote 1 Area classification of Kumamoto Prefecture The structure of this paper is as follows: the next section explains the damage and reconstruction of the earthquake for background and reviews previous literature. The third section describes the methodology for the estimation and analysis of changes in expenditures and those ripple effects. The fourth section discusses the estimation result.

Tokyo remains the most visited region by overall origin and purpose of visit throughout Japanese prefectures in 2011–2019, whose visit rate ranged from 46% to 52% (Japan National Tourism Organization 2020a). The number of foreign visitors to Tokyo has been increasing regularly in the same period as above where regional share to national in terms of the number of foreign guests at the accommodation was between 26% and 33%, with more than half of total visitors coming from East Asia (e.g., China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong) and the United States, which is similar to in overall Japan (Japan National Tourism Organization 2020b; see Fig. 1). Source: Japan National Tourism Organization (2020b) Accumulated number of guests at accommodations. Furthermore, domestically, predominant overnight visitors came from Hokkaido, Aichi, and Osaka, while prevalent single-day visitors came from internal Tokyo, Shizuoka, and some prefectures in Tokyo Greater Area, such as Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, and Ibaraki. Regardless of the type of trip taken, internal Tokyo, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa dominated the visitors’ origins category (Japan Tourism Agency 2018a). Conventional studies on the economic impact of regional tourism mainly focus on measuring multipliers and their effects on inter-sectoral linkages in a specific, single administrative area. Only a few were discussed in a two-region (bi-regional) interregional input–output framework, such as in, but not limited to Balearic Island and the Rest of Spain (Soulie and Valle, 2014), Galicia and the Rest of Spain (Incera et al. 2015), and Northeast and the Rest of Brazil (Guilhoto et al. 2002). The same applies to Japan, e.g., Kyoto (Tsukui and Kagatsume 2017), Tokyo and Kyoto (Tsukui et al. 2017), and Shizuoka (Patandianan and Shibusawa 2020). Yet, fewer explained how tourism triggers repercussion effects on other regions back and forth, and describe the sectoral interdependency between two regions and two sectors. In light of the abovementioned situations, taking a case study in Tokyo Metropolitan, tourism-induced multiplier, spillover and feedback effects, sectoral interdependence, and regional self-sufficiency based on Miyazawa’s partitioned matrix multipliers and interregional repercussion model (Miyazawa 1976) are explored. In this study, visitors’ expenditure in Tokyo is distinguished further into that of domestic visitors—referred to as non-residents of Tokyo—and that of inbound visitors. Besides, ‘sector’ represents a particular component of a region’s economic activity that is specified in the input–output table (e.g., agriculture, forestry and fishery), while ‘industry’ refers to those not literally enlisted in the studied input–output table including sectoral agglomeration (e.g., light industry, tourism industry). Furthermore, tourism-led multiplier, spillover, and feedback effects are evaluated in the abovementioned domestic-inbound setting. On the above account, there are three main objectives of this study. First, to examine the total contribution of domestic and inbound visitors’ expenditure in Tokyo by using a two-region interregional input–output (IRIO) framework in terms of output, income, value-added, and employment, as well as its multiplier decomposition to understand the transmission mechanism of tourism effects. Second, to explore the interregional repercussion effects between Tokyo and the rest of Japan. Finally, to investigate the interdependency between tourism-related sectors and other sectors in Tokyo. The internal and external matrix multipliers, sub-internal matrix multipliers, and inside propagation ratios based on Miyazawa’s partitioned multiplier model were measured to achieve the two last goals. The earliest applications of the interregional input–output model were pioneered by Isard (1951), Chenery (1953), and Moses (1955). Chenery in Yamada (1963), specifically, divides a national economy into two subnational economies and conducts a two-region interregional input–output study. Furthermore, Miyazawa (1976) develops partitioned matrix multipliers to assess the interdependency between the goods-producing sector and the service sector in Japan, further examining the interdependency of sectors between Hokkaido and the rest of Japan (ROJ). It is found that the goods-producing sector has more inducible power from one sector to another than the service sector and that there is a substantial dependence of Japan’s service sectors on its goods-producing sectors. Moreover, the sub-multipliers indicate a high dependency of Hokkaido’s activities on ROJ’s industries, and that there has been a ripple effect from Hokkaido to ROJ, putting ROJ’s industries in a favorable position. In addition, Miyazawa highlights that certain sectors in the light industry group (e.g., textiles, rubber products, leather and leather products, printing and publishing, and miscellaneous manufactured articles), as well as those in the non-manufacture industry (services, trade, and public utilities), are among Hokkaido’s self-sufficient industries that are relatively least dependent on ROJ’s activities. On the other hand, heavy industries (e.g., iron and steel, non-ferrous metal products) and resource industries (e.g., metal mining, non-metal mining, pulp, paper and paper products, fishing) are among those that are highly dependent on ROJ’s activities (Miyazawa 1976). Most recently, Patandianan and Shibusawa (2020) have evaluated the spillover effects of tourism demands in Shizuoka Prefecture using a municipality-level interregional input–output model, where they have found outstanding induced production values identified in the sectors of personal services; commerce, transport, and postal services; and food products and beverages, led by Shizuoka City, Hamamatsu, Ito, Atami, and Gotenba. Furthermore, some highest induced production coefficients have been identified in Higashi Izu Town, Atami, Izunokuni, and Shimoda, while smaller coefficients were observed in Mori Town, Fukuroi, Makinohara, and Koyama Town. Moreover, smaller towns are affected by other areas with higher sensitivity ratios identified in smaller municipalities, while greater tourism demand was associated with bigger cities, such as Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, Numazu, and Fuji. Incera et al. (2015) argue how spillover effects of tourist consumption include multipliers and leakages between Galicia and the rest of Spain in 2001–2007. The results highlight imbalanced spillover effects between the two regions. For example, a €1 consumption in final demand in Galicia creates €0.30 in the Rest of Spain, and yet creates only €0.013 the other way around. Furthermore, Galicia’s economic structure relies more on the exploitation of natural resources with limited specialization in the production of outputs demanded by tourists, making it a non-favorable, non-specialized tourist destination. Moreover, Galicia’s productive sector is highly dependent on the rest of Spain to meet its tourism demands, such as food products and beverages, transport and communication services, and real estate activities. The results also mention that in 2007 tourism consumption in Galicia constituted 4.1% of domestic output, 4.7% of gross value added, and created 47,286 full-time jobs, with 60% of tourism consumption coming from non-residents, followed by residents (18%) and foreigners (12%). Finally, commodity leakage from Galicia to the rest of Spain is estimated to be at about 20%. Tourism-induced interaction between two regions has been researched thoroughly in the case of the Balearic Islands and the Rest of Spain (Soulie and Valle 2014). Unlike previous studies in Galicia, the Balearic Islands’ economy is substantially entrenched in tourism. The most important finding of the study is that the Balearic Islands’ industries have created higher multipliers than those of the Rest of Spain. For example, the contribution of a €1 expenditure in final demand to national output from the Balearic Islands and the Rest of Spain are €0.88 and €0.76, respectively. Furthermore, the transportation sector has distinguished itself to be the most outstanding sector in terms of net spillover effects, namely, water transportation (0.77) from the Balearic Islands to the Rest of Spain, and air transportation in vice versa (0.01). A similar tourism case study on Japan is found in the 2005 inter-regional input–output table of Japan (METI 2010), discussing the production repercussion effects of consumption by foreigners visiting Hokkaido. The study finds that 44 billion yen in foreign visitors’ consumption in Hokkaido can generate about 71 billion yen of domestic production inducement effect, with about 1.7 times in direct demand, causing an indirect effect of induced domestic products by the goods and construction-and-service sectors to be dominated by Hokkaido. Specifically, regional induced domestic products in the monetary unit show that Hokkaido’s both goods sector (beverage and foods; and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries) and construction-and-service sectors (personal services, transport, and commerce) were leading compared to those of the other regions. In addition, Hokkaido’s personal services sector, including accommodation as its leading subsector, was recognized as the most outstanding sector for the induced domestic product among all the 53 sectors in 9 Japanese regions, accounting for 31.5 billion yen. Tsukui et al. suggest another perspective of analyzing tourism consumption impact, by employing a regional waste input–output approach to examine the repercussion effect of tourism consumption by Chinese, Taiwan, and South Korean Tourist in Kyoto City (Tsukui and Kagatsume 2017) and the comparison of such effect of tourism consumption by Tokyo and Kyoto (Tsukui et al. 2017), which bring up the analysis beyond economic multipliers that include ecological adverse impacts, such as waste generation, landfilling, and greenhouse gases emissions. This paper is organized into 4 sections and 3 subsections. First, the introduction covers the research background, problems, objectives, and literature review on the previous applications of the interregional input–output model in service and tourism-related sectors. Then, the methods include materials and methodology built upon Miyazawa’s partitioned matrix multipliers on interregional repercussion and inter-sectoral interdependency model. Next, the results and discussion describe the contributions of Tokyo’s domestic and inbound tourists, its decomposition, interregional repercussion effects in a two-region interregional input–output framework, and the inter-sectoral interdependency between tourism and other sectors. The paper will be resolved by the final section that provides the conclusions of the study.",

Nonetheless, theory contends that by distorting resource allocation away from productive activities, sustained real exchange rate overvaluation will eventually lead to drastic adjustments of relative prices and reduction of aggregate economic growth (Ndlela 2010). Additionally, overvalued exchange rates are known to potentially undermine exports, harm agriculture, services and the industrial sectors, stimulate imports, breed protection against imports, promote rent-seeking economies, and to destabilize the capital account as well as often precipitating debt crises (Rodrik 2008). For the services sector in particular, an overvalued exchange rate is likely to adversely affect components such as the tourism (Dubas 2009), whereby the tourism-dependent countries suffer loss in export revenues as local currency is overvalued, making these countries undesirable destinations for international tourists. On the contrary, an undervalued currency is credited not only for reducing unemployment and lowering the risk of financial crises (Steinberg 2015), but also acting as an implicit subsidy to firms that sell abroad (The Economist 2020). While in the services sector, an undervalued currency may attract tourists to the country since it becomes cheaper for them to visit, consequently leading to more foreign exchange flowing into the country, undervaluation could be considered anathema to firms in the service sector given its likelihood of upscaling their costs without improving their competitiveness (Steinberg 2015). For industries that rely on some imported inputs, and others that borrow from foreign banks to finance their investments in services, the effect of undervaluation may be deleterious. Nevertheless, the empirical association between undervaluation and sectoral performance is still an inconclusive debate. The main purpose of the current study is to examine the effect of undervaluation on the service sector performance in East Africa, a region that is now considered the fastest growing in the world, with the services sector, which includes everything from finance, insurance, communication, restaurants and tourism to real estate, and therefore an archetypal nontradable sector, taking the lead (UNECA 2018). For example, the regional statistics for the year 2018 indicate that the sector dominated the composition of GDP, averaging 59% and only followed by the agricultural sector, averaging 25.7%. The average contribution of the service sector to GDP over the period 1991–2017, was 42.9% followed by the agricultural sector with 30.7% and the manufacturing sector with 7.8% and industrial sector at 18.2%. In fact, a steady performance of the sector is witnessed since 1991 when it contributed about 39% to GDP, proceeding to 42.3%, 45.7% and 59% in 2001, 2011, and 2018 respectively, compared to a deteriorating contribution from the agriculture and manufacturing sectors that in 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2017, respectively stood at 10%, 6.8%, 8.4% and 6.7%, for the latter, and 37.4%, 29.7%, 26.1% and 29.8% for the former sector. This relatively better performance of the service sector has taken place against a backdrop of a weakening currency and growing interest in deeper regional integration that begun with the signing of the treaty for the establishment of the East African Community by the heads of State of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in November 1999, and the coming into force of the same in July 2000. While a plethora of studies document findings in support of an undervaluation-real-exchange-led growth (e.g., Seraj and Coskuner 2021; Missio et al. 2015; Couharde and Sallenave 2013), empirical support underpinning the negative growth impact of undervalued and overvalued exchange rate is equally traceable (e.g., Mbaye 2013; Conrad and Jagessar 2018). On the contrary, a later study by Brixiová and Ncube (2014) finds no evidence of a facilitative role of undervaluation, where the latter is measured from the stock flow approach. Yet, arguments in defense of an overvalued find basis too in literature (e.g., Steinberg 2010; Dutta and Leon 2002). The exact explanation for the divergences is not straight forward but as Rapetti et al. (2012) suggest, the source of diversion appears entrenched in sample differences as well as measurement variations and the type of growth indicator selected (Mazorodze and Tewari 2018). We consider the above issues central in the current study. First, we explore one sector at a regional level to determine both the shortrun and longrun effects of undervaluation, taking into consideration both endogeneity and heterogeneity as well as homogeneity issues in addition to cross-sectional dependence among countries. More importantly, and as a nuance to the study, we additionally investigate both the direct and indirect effects of regional integration on the service sector performance, as well as the feedback effects from the monetary and fiscal policy. Previous studies have mainly focused on the savings channel (e.g., Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger 2007), the capital accumulation channel (e.g., Mazorodze and Tewari 2018), as well as the currency regime channel (e.g., Brixiová and Ncube 2014), and, total factor productivity channel (e.g., Mbaye 2013). Finally, given the documented evidence in previous studies such as Mazorodze and Tewari (2018), of a non-linear effect of currency or exchange rate misalignment on economic growth, we also test for this possibility in our data. The contribution of the above analysis falls into various categories. First, it is envisaged that the findings from our study could provide an evidence-base for relevant policies directed towards the relevant sector rather than would have been the case where a one-size-fits-all-blanket policy would emanate from aggregating sectors together. For, we argue that different sectors are affected differently by undervaluation/overvaluation, thus justifying a sector-wide approach. On the other hand, the study outcome could add to the scanty evidence in existence for East Africa, in addition to providing avenues for further research. In a region that entertains the hope of becoming a monetary union, where an adoption of a single currency is on the agenda in an effort to foster deeper integration and better manage the prices of goods and services, understanding the dynamics of the exchange rate movement for specific sectors is critical for the future stability of the East African Monetary Union (EAMU). The main conclusion is that there is significant influence of undervaluation as well as regional integration and real exchange volatility on services sector performance. The East Africa community as well as monetary and fiscal policy channels play a critical role in the undervaluation-services sector linkage. We also note that the relationship between currency undervaluation and service sector performance follows an inverted U-shaped curve, whereby beyond a threshold of about 6.3, the undervaluation effect turns out negative, otherwise smaller and moderate undervaluation from about 1–6.3 is still good for the service sector development in the selected EAC countries. In the next section, is the review of literature, followed by the methodological section incorporation data and the estimation strategy. Section 4 then entails the results and discussion while Sect. 5 concludes.",2

SUTs are also a building block of models intended for detailed economic impact assessment, extensively applied in many fields, including assessment of the impact of the natural resource use. The governmental agencies produce these mainly at the national level to derive components related to the calculation of the gross domestic product (GDP). The national SUTs, however, do not capture the heterogeneity of regions within a single country. This deficiency is problematic as the differences between regions and subnational interdependencies can be substantial. It follows from industries’ diversification in terms of the production structure that may be related to the location, availability of resources, or ability to attract talent. A policy that is targeting a specific sector when the reliance on that sector varies between regions will produce unevenly distributed economic effects. While it is clear that regional SUTs have a great potential for policymakers who may be interested in the localized effects of their decisions, these are rarely available. Detailed regional tables are often a product of a specific project with a limited sectoral focus, available for a narrow time frame, and rarely set for routine updating. This is because such products are data-intensive, requiring information on the whole range of industries that comprise the region’s economy. Compiling data from all sectors and ensuring its consistency across takes resources and time (Jensen and Macdonald 1982). Values are often available only for an aggregate (Oosterhaven et al. 1986). As a result, timely policy advice based on regional SUTs is rare. Instead, economic impact inputs to policy-making decisions tend to be based on tables updated with limited data using a hybrid approach in which superior information (e.g., focused survey, expert opinion) is incorporated into otherwise mechanically updated tables (Lahr 1993). The multiregional generalized RAS (MR-GRAS) technique described in Temursho et al. (2020) offers an advanced approach to updating a partitioned matrix that needs to conform to new row sums, column sums and, additionally, non-overlapping aggregation constraints. While using row and column constraints is at the core of more traditional updating methods (e.g., RAS method), adding aggregation constraints provides an opportunity to maximize the utilization of available data by making use of the national-level statistics. Temursho et al. (2020) application of the MR-GRAS technique to SUTs, however, does not necessarily guarantee a consistent structure of the updated tables. This technical note proposes a simple modification to the structure of the benchmark matrix that guarantees the supply–use accounting balance as well as the identity of GDP by income and GDP by expenditure at the regional level in the output matrix. As a result, the procedure allows efficient production of tables appropriate for calculating multiplier effects and estimating regional economic impacts. This note’s contribution also lies in the empirical application, presenting an example of using the MR-GRAS method. It demonstrates the far-reaching economic impacts of fisheries management policies that alter catch limits for commercial harvesters using the Pacific halibut commercial fishery in Alaska as a case study. The step-by-step instructions on how to apply the approach should be of interest to any researcher working on regional economic analysis, regardless of the focus sector.",

Since the 2000s numerous studies have emphasized the gap between what countries say about their exchange regime and what they actually do. This has led to the development of alternative classification methods based on statistical data, termed de facto classifications. Since 1999, even the IMF has used its staff judgements in classifying its member countries’ regimes rather than relying exclusively on what countries claim it to be. It is important, however, to investigate not only de facto exchange rate regimes, but also to identify the degree of de facto exchange rate flexibility. The present paper is based on the approach developed by Frankel and Wei (2008) designed to estimate the basket of currencies to which a currency is pegged, as well as de facto degree of exchange rate flexibility. Officially, since 1994, the Bank of Algeria has implemented a managed float exchange rate policy with the objective of maintaining the real effective exchange rate (REER) close to its equilibrium level. In this paper, we are interested in examining a number of questions by empirically investigating the actual behaviour of Algeria’s exchange rate: Has Algeria adopted a managed float regime as officially claimed, or a crawling peg and band around the US dollar and Euro? Has there been a change in the degree of de facto exchange rate flexibility for the dinar over time? The central focus of this work in hand is twofold: the first is to assess whether Algeria is among fear of floating countries, and the second is to provide a de facto classification for Algeria’s exchange regime. To these ends, this paper applies ordinary least square (OLS) to estimate Frankel and Wei (2008) regression. The OLS rolling window methodology is also used to estimate this regression in order to obtain a better estimation of the changes in the currency regime. Wavelet methods such as Wavelet Multiple Correlation and Wavelet Local Multiple Correlation proposed by Fernández-Macho (2012, 2018) are also applied to examine the co-movement between the Algerian dinar, US dollar and Euro in the time scale domain. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two briefly discusses the literature that deals with identifying exchange regimes. Section three reviews a brief history of the exchange regime in Algeria and discusses the results of testing the fear of floating hypothesis in that country. Section four details the methodology employed. Section five presents the model specification and data. Section six presents the empirical findings, and the last section proposes some conclusions and recommendations for decision-makers.",

In addition, the foreign exchange rate plays a vital role in some economies. More specifically, due to its effects on the firms’ products and input price, it can potentially influence the nominal (inflation) and real (investment and economic growth) sectors of an economy (Bahmani-Oskooee and Saha 2016). Hence, another monetary policy aim is affecting the foreign exchange rate (Senay and Sutherland 2019). On the other hand, the FIs can potentially affect real sectors of an economy due to their roles in financing investment through mobilizing resources (Levine 2005; McKinnon 1982; Seven and Yetkiner 2016; Greenbaum et al. 2019). Moreover, whether the FIs can be a hedge for reduction of money value or not (Li, Narayan and Zheng 2010) has been a controversial issue for decades. Therefore, the monetary policy, the FEM, and the FIs could have some common impacts. Accordingly, there is a strong link between monetary policy, the FEM, and the FIs. In other words, the effects of monetary policy can be transmitted to nominal and real sectors of an economy by the channel of the FIs (Beck et al. 2014; Terra and Arestis 2017) and the FEM. One of the monetary instruments which can realize this link between the FIs, the FEM, and Monetary policy is IR. The success of monetary policy in reaching its aims through the FIs and the FEM depends on which financial market will absorb further liquidity. It might influence the nominal and real economic indicators differently if the liquidity direction is toward the stock market, Bank deposits, or speculation in the FEM. Attracting liquidity by the FIs depends on the factors, such as inflation and the measure of risk. On this basis, increasing or at least keeping the value of different assets causes the investors to choose the FIs or the other financial markets based on their potentials. Bank deposits and the stock market have enough potential to be in the circle of investor’s choices. However, investing in bank deposits might encounter the risk of value lowering due to the negative real interest rate (RIR) originating from high inflation and repression of nominal interest rate (NIR). On the other hand, even with the attractiveness of the stock market to investors in the inflationary conditions due to growth of firms’ products price, it might also face the risk of increasing input price and, therefore, going up their costs. In brief, foreseeing the profitability outlook of firms would be difficult for investors in such a situation. Another critical point is that holding cash might have almost gotten out of investors’ choice because of decreasing its value over time due to the probable inflationary environment. The exchange rate volatility can negatively affect investment by creating speculative activities and increasing uncertainty (Singleton 1987). The speculative activities in some financial markets might be a substitute for the FIs in attracting liquidity (Allen and Gale 1997). In this respect, given the fixed exchange rate and the high share of oil and its derivatives exports in the whole foreign currency reserves, the power of Iran’s Central Bank to support the aimed exchange rate through supplying foreign currency proportional with demand level is affected by negative oil shocks. In particular, the severe reduction in foreign currency reserves due to the USA sanctions has made many unwanted limitations for Iran’s Central Bank in providing enough supply. Hence, this matter creates enough conditions to form a gap between official and unofficial exchange rates. Therefore, in addition to high inflation, due to the gap between exchange rates, the FEM turned into a market where had enough potential to compete with the stock market and bank deposits for absorbing liquidity through the gains of speculation. The inflation rate and investments in Iran’s economy have not shown a stable situation over the decades and have always faced high fluctuations. One of the factors that played a decisive role is cash flow. Due to remarkable capital gains of price fluctuations, liquidity has mainly been attracted by the markets whose goal is to obtain short-term profits from speculation. This issue has also affected financing the productive economic activities and the price level through creating false demands. In the developed economies, given the stability of general price level and its fluctuations in the determined range which sets and manages by central banks, the competition for attracting liquidity is mainly between bank deposits and the stock market; thus, the other markets are less attractive due to being low of capital gains from price fluctuations. As discussed above, given the potential effects which IR has on the FEM, bank deposits, and loans, and consequently, the performance of firms listed on the stock market, it will also have the potential impacts on the central bank’s power to lead liquidity between the different financial markets in order to reach the monetary policy aims. In other words, the IR can fulfill the monetary policy aims by realizing the link between the FIs, the FEM, and monetary policy to transmit monetary policy effects to real and nominal sectors of the economy. However, Iran’s Central Bank has almost been passive against the high fluctuation of the inflation rate and the relationship between speculation in the FEM and the FIs due to repression of NIR (will be discussed in detail later). Based on discussed cases, first sight concerning previous studies at this domain is that due to the stability of inflation rate in the developed and emerging economies, they have not paid enough attention to the probable relationship between the speculative activities in financial markets and the FIs and their competition over attracting liquidity in the countries where exists a high level of price fluctuations. The second is that they have not studied the role of monetary policy in leading liquidity between the FIs and speculation in other financial markets. Third, not considering these relations at different regimes. The last one is that no study has considered the mentioned entire cases simultaneously to reach more comparable and comprehensive results. Therefore, our contributions are to fade these gaps and add some valuations to existing studies. Iran is a developing economy in which the central bank is not independent of the government’s fiscal policy and thus has faced limitations regarding financial resources due to the economic sanctions. In this respect, the debt volume of Iran’s government to central bank has been noticeably high. On the other hand, most firms have encountered insufficient financial resources, while the motivations of speculative activities have been high because of high fluctuation in some financial markets, like the FEM, at the same time. That is why the role of monetary policy in influencing the economy through the channel of financial markets to attract enough liquidity is considered essential. Hence, the main aim is to see whether the central bank and its monetary policy could affect the inflation and investment through the channel of the FEM and the FIs (leading liquidity between the aimed financial markets to transmit the effects of monetary policy to the nominal and real sectors of Iran’s economy). For this purpose, we are supposed to investigate whether there is a significant relationship between bank deposits, the stock market, and speculation in the FEM? How are these relations at different regimes? Is there competition between these markets in attracting liquidity, or is there a complementary relationship between them? How is the impact of every one of these markets on inflation and investment at different regimes? Given the repression of NIR and the inflationary environment of Iran’s economics, how is the effect of RIR on these markets and the relations between them? The present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses monetary policy in Iran’s economy. Section 3 pays attention to background literature. Section 4 assigns empirical model and specifying. The empirical results are paid by Sect. 5. Section 6 is devoted to discussion. The conclusions with policy implications are provided in Sect. 7.",1

Financial markets are expected to aggregate all information, but imitative behaviours do not allow to take benefits from information symmetry (Romano 2009). It is a general concept that the decisions of irrational investors cause inconveniences in markets. Academic research on social learning and behavioural convergences has assisted in the understanding of such issues (Bikhchandani et al., 1998). Theoretical development in this area has revealed that what often seems irrational is actually a rational decision in a certain natural context (Hirshleifer and Hong Teoh 2003). Decision-making of individuals is affected by certain phenomenon which controls the contexts in which decisions are made. Herding is one example of this kind of phenomenon (Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2001). The end result of herding is the conformance of behaviours on a single point. In finance, efficient market hypothesis (EMH) considers markets as a fair place where stocks, currencies or other commodities are traded according to market demand and supply. According to this concept, value of an asset is calculated based on readily available market information. So, an investor can buy stock at the fair price only (Rossi and Gunardi 2018). On the other hand, this assumption of rationality often fails in capital market, that leads to the concepts of behavioural finance. Traders of these two fields are classified as fundamentalists and chartists, respectively (Kaltwasser 2010). Herding behaviour is one example when investors behave irrationally in markets. Specifically, herding is the physical clumping or convergence of actions. It is defined as “a process where economic agents are imitating each other's actions and/or base their decisions upon the actions of others” (Spyrou, 2015, p.175). According to Spyrou, these may include market participants whose trading is in the similar direction in one time, investors ignoring their analysis and initial trade and follow the trends of others, mutual imitation, single behaviour convergence at one point, a correlated behaviour, or a group of investors following each other. Banerjee (1992) developed a simple model to explain herding behaviour with a common real-word example and showed how easy it is to follow the decisions of others in decision-making. Foreign exchange market is full of dynamic trends. Herding is a phenomenon of developing and frontier markets (Economou, 2016). In forex market, investors tend to imitate the behaviour of others for investment in foreign currencies. Most of the research focuses on describing the trends among stock markets, but forex market has not received much attention, especially with reference of herding. Since last two years, herding in cryptocurrencies are in more focus of researchers (Ajaz and Kumar, 2018; Stavros and Vassilios 2019; Bouri et al. 2019; Kaiser and Stöckl 2019; Ballis and Drakos 2019). This fact cannot be denied that cryptocurrency has attracted investors in Pakistan like rest of the world. The underlying problem is that cryptocurrency has not gained the legal status in the legislation of Pakistan. A number of significant factors are affecting the right use of virtual currencies in the country [see (Yasir and Ahmed 2021)]. For this reason, present study observes herding behaviour of traditional currencies only, as investors are not encouraged towards cryptocurrencies and exchange rate of conventional currencies is the main reason of economic up and down. Forex market is affected by home country investors, companies involved in import’s business and the remittances from foreign countries (Khurshid et al. 2017). In Pakistan, exchange rate is highly affected by increased imports, political situations and the labour population residing in other countries. This motivates home country investors to invest in foreign currencies. In different times, market displays unexpected returns due to behaviours of investors. Considering this issue, the aim of this study is to expand literature on herding, by exploring herding behaviour in Pakistani Forex market. Researchers have found no other study specifically contributing towards herding literature in currencies in Pakistan. Currencies under study are listed for trading in top platforms. Herding behaviour of home country investors is analysed in current study. Thus, our empirical analysis uses prices of six currencies, over a period of 5 years and examines whether these currencies exhibit herding behaviour or not. This research paper is organized in five sections. Introduction of the article talks about behavioural finance and the need of studying herding behaviour in Pakistan forex market. Literature review builds up theoretical background and describes empirical literature on herding. Methodology section contains description of models to be analysed, statistical and estimation techniques. Section 4 discusses results of estimations. At the end, conclusion is presented in last section.",

It has changed the way in which people communicate with each other, how they find the required information, work, perform business activities, interact with government agencies, and how they manage their social lives (Roztocki et al. 2019). ICT also plays a major role in contributing towards the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Tjoa and Tjoa 2016), particularly in contributing to SDG 9.Footnote 1 Moreover, due to the big revolution in the ICT sector, a paradigm shift has been taking place in human development (Yakunina and Bychkov 2015). The revolution of ICT is considered as the main driving force for globalization (Ogunsola 2005) by promoting trade, investment, and business both domestically and internationally. It contributes to the globalization process by contributing to infrastructure for trans-world connections (Faye 2000). Globalization is important for human development because it influences its three dimensions, income, health, and education. And the interaction of globalization and ICT is considered as an important tool for human existence (Ogunsola 2005). Developing countries like India are using ICT as a powerful tool in order to eradicate poverty, reduce health hazards and mortality, and increase universal education and sustainable development (United Nations Development Programme, UNDP 2004). India, one of the fast-growing economies in the world, is the largest exporter of ICT-related services since the 1990s. The information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, which are the components of ICT contribute nearly eight percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of India and provide employment opportunities to nearly four million people in 2018 (Seconded European Standardisation Expert in India, SESEI 2019). Moreover, the Government of India has launched the Digital India programme in 2015 to make ICTs a key policy strategy to transform the country into a digital economy by providing infrastructure, access to technology, and government services to citizens. According to a recent report of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI 2020), the country’s total internet subscribers base and total broadband subscribers base increased to 743.19 million and 687.44 million in 2020, respectively, from 636.729 million and 563.31 million in 2019. Additionally, it is also expected that by 2025, India’s core digital sectors like IT and business process management, electronics manufacturing, and digital communication services could increase the GDP level to $355–$435 billion (Kaka et al. 2019). Despite the strong and rapid growth of the IT sector in India, people who are living in rural areas (and especially the poor people) have limited access to ICTs in terms of accessibility of internet, mobile and computer facilities for which they face the problem of incomplete/asymmetric information in their daily life (Rao 2005). Therefore, India is still lagging behind the other developed as well as developing countries in terms of ICT contribution to human development. On the other hand, there are a significant number of studies that are solely based on ICT and economic growth (Kurniawati 2021; Sahoo et al. 2021; Tripathi and Inani 2020; David and Grobler 2020; Haftu 2019; Zhang and Danish 2019; Niebel 2018; Toader et al. 2018; Ghosh 2017; Hwang and Shin 2017; Albiman and Sulong 2017; Hofman et al. 2016; Salahuddin and Alam 2016; Farhadi et al. 2012). Also, some studies like David and Grobler (2020), David (2019a, b), Asongu and Roux (2017), Gupta et al. (2019), Gholami et al. (2010), and UNDP (2004) focus on ICT and human development. Moreover, a couple of studies in literature had tried to study globalization and human development (Figueroa 2015; Cieślik 2014; Sapkota 2011; Ajija and Kusreni 2011; Tsai 2007; Sabi 2007). In India, though a large number of studies are undertaken on ICT and economic growth (Krishna et al. 2018; Erumban and Das 2016; Singh 2015; Sahoo 2012; Veeramacheneni et al. 2008) a few studies are carried out on ICT and human development (Neogi 2020; Sahay and Walsham 2017; Jensen 2007). However, most of the previous studies theoretically tried to examine the relationship between ICT and socio-economic development in the process of globalization in developing countries (Simba 2004; Ogunsola 2005; Alexandru et al. 2007). A study by Simba (2004) has discussed how ICT in the wake of globalization affects the health information system (health) in developing countries. It is found that developing countries nourish their health by applying ICT with the help of globalization. Similarly, another study by Ogunsola (2005) has tried to measure how ICT affects the economies of developing countries with the help of the globalization process. In India, particularly in Bangalore, Narayana (2010) has shown the contribution of the ICT sector towards globalization and urban economic growth. But this study is limited to economic growth rather than human development. To date, there have been no empirical studies that analyse the relationships between ICT, globalization, and human development in India. Though Narayana (2010) has undertaken a study on ICT, globalization and economic growth, it has some limitations, i.e. it takes (1) international trade and capital (FDI) to measure globalization rather KOF globalization index (which is a recent one and widely used); (2) economic growth rather human development; (3) this study is limited to one city (Bangalore) of India rather the country as a whole, and (4) time period 1980–2004 rather the latest time period. The present study has answered the relevant research questions, i.e. how does ICT through globalization affect human development in India? Does there exist any asymmetric relationships between ICT, globalization, and human development? It is also essential to know whether the increase in investment in ICT enhances the socio-economic development of India. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to examine the asymmetric relationships between ICT, globalization, and human development in India from 1991 to 2019. The originality of the paper is based on three things. Firstly, this paper has studied the relationships between ICT, globalization, and human development in India for the first time. Secondly, this paper has employed the latest method, i.e. the NARDL model which has not been adopted in the previous studies to account for the non-linear or asymmetric relationships between ICT, globalization, and human development, and thirdly, this paper has used the latest data (i.e. from 1991 to 2019) which can give an updated scenario for policymakers. This paper is organized in the following manner: Sect. 2 analyses the stylized facts on the Indian Economy. Section 3 discusses the review of the literature on ICT, globalization, and human development. Section 4 deals with the theoretical framework. Section 5 presents the data sources and method. Section 6 includes the result and discussions while Sect. 7 concludes with some policy suggestions.",

Thus, at the suggestion of Bert Steenge, I checked my files and found a correspondence between Wassily Leontief and Thijs ten Raa on the reswitching of techniques in 1985–1986. Reswitching was the focal point of the capital debate between Cambridge, USA, and Cambridge, UK. The Americans represented the neoclassical school, according to which the factor distribution of income between capitalists and workers is determined by the marginal productivities of capital and labor. Neoclassical economists base their theory on a macroeconomic production function that maps quantities of the two-factor inputs—capital and labor—into a quantity of output. The production function has the usual property of diminishing marginal products. The greater the labor force, the lesser their productivity, and likewise for capital. Equilibrium with the supply of labor and capital determines the factor prices. A serious foundation of such a macroeconomic production function had been given by Houthakker (1955). He argued that if the microeconomic production units have fixed input coefficients, but the coefficients differ across the production units, then the aggregate production function features substitutability of capital and labor, as an increase in the wage rate will bankrupt labor-intensive production units, and likewise for an increase in the rate of return to capital. In fact, Houthakker demonstrated that if the input coefficients follow a Pareto distribution, then the aggregate production function is Cobb–Douglas. Of course, different input distributions across production units will generate different aggregate production functions; see ten Raa (2019) for a review. The Cambridge, UK, economists represented the classical school, according to which the factor distribution of income between capitalists and workers is not determined by marginal productivities, but by other mechanism, such as class struggle. They argued that the neoclassical assumption of a decreasing relationship between factor intensity and factor reward need not hold. The source of the trouble is that capital consists of produced commodities, such as machinery and equipment. There is an aggregation issue, which neoclassical economists assume away. A symptom of the aggregation issue is that as the rate of return on capital increases, a capital-intensive technology may be substituted out—as neoclassical economists would predict since the rate of return is the price of capital for entrepreneurs—but the capital-intensive technology may reemerge at a still greater rate of return. This phenomenon of reswitching of techniques contradicts the construct of a macroeconomic production function and its use in the distribution of income. Loud criticaster and defender of the neoclassical school of thought were Joan Robinson and Bob Solow, respectively; for a review of the capital controversies, see Cohen and Harcourt (2003). However, the best intellectuals among the neoclassical opponents and their opponents, Paul Samuelson and Luigi Pasinetti, respectively, were basically in agreement. In fact, in an early paper Samuelson himself provided an example of reswitching. Samuelson (1966) did so in the context of an Austrian circulating-capital model, where capital is input that is in the pipeline of production. Labor-intensive and time-intensive techniques coexist, and reswitching may occur. In the simplest input–output analytic terms the Austrian model of circulating capital can be based on x(t) = Ax(t + 1) + y(t), where t is time, x is the gross output vector, y the net output vector, and A the matrix of input–output coefficients. This equation subsumes a single technique for every product, with a unitary lag of production. To produce output, the inputs must be available one unit ahead of time. Distributive lags in production have been analyzed and estimated by ten Raa (1986), who solves for the path of gross outputs that sustains a path of net outputs, and ten Raa et al. (1989), who estimate different production lags. Alternative techniques can be introduced by working directly with the use and make tables (which underlie the A matrix): Vs = Us + y, where s is the vector of activity levels, U the use table and V the make table. U and V are rectangular, reflecting that there may be more activities than products, a source of substitution. Production time lags may vary as in ten Raa et al. (1989) and this modification would yield a full-blown input–output model of Austrian circulating capital. Leontief, however, modeled capital not as circulating but as fixed, using a matrix of capital coefficients B. The row vector of product prices fulfills p = pA + rpB + l, normalizing the price of labor at 1, denoting the rate of return on capital by r, and assuming perfect competition (zero profit). Leontief (1986) considered the possibility of reswitching an empirical issue and investigated if the phenomenon occurs in the U.S. economy. In this paper Leontief mentioned that a numerical test example can easily be constructed of a simple, say, three sector input–output system in which the cooking recipes are such that some recipes would drop out if the rate of return goes up from 5% to say 10%, but reappear again when it rises to 15%. He did not spell out an example. We corresponded on this paper. I wrote that reswitching can be shown in an even simpler input–output system, with only two sectors. He wrote the paper was rejected by “our leading economic journal” (the American Economic Review). “It might amuse you to know that the editor rejected it explaining that it would be of no interest to its readers.” In this note I present the example and position Leontief’s model in the capital literature.",

Such analyses are often commissioned or supported by central banks, which aim is to achieve and maintain price stability. For practical reasons, studies on pass-through and price formation are concentrated on two main primary impulses, basing on the cost theory. The first one comes from changes in the prices of imports (due to changes in prices expressed in foreign currency or changes in exchange rate). The second is taxes, mainly VAT (e.g., Benedek et al. 2020; Ardalan and Kessing 2019). Other investigations concern interest rate pass-through (Cook 2008) and generally the effectiveness of monetary policies (Leszczyńska-Paczesna 2020). Among the above-mentioned research trends, the most intense work is focused on exchange rate pass-through (ERPT), which means studying how exchange rate fluctuations influence domestic prices (e.g., Aron et al. 2014; Auer and Schoenle 2016; Pennings 2017). In general, these models are based on the cost formula in a more or less direct way. Some of them combine cost and demand factors (Shakeri and Gray 2013; Beckman et al. 2019). Other macroeconomic studies investigate the role of interest rates and money supply. Most of them are based on multi-equation econometric models, such as VAR, SVAR or VEC. These research do not exploit the potential of a tool known for many decades, which is the input–output (IO) price model. The model originated in the seminal paper by Leontief (1937), and he was also the first to employ it (Leontief 1946). We can find various studies where the initial impulse is a change in import prices (see, e.g., Wu et al. 2013) or unit value added and taxes not included there (e.g., Lee et al. 2000; Boratyński 2006; Sharify and Sancho 2011). ERPT can also be investigated, considering the prices of imported products as the external prices expressed in foreign currency multiplied by the exchange rate (Aydoğuş et al. 2017). Research done so far are focused on particular aspects of price formation, they do not test or discuss the overall performance of the model. The presented study is intended to be a step towards filling this gap. In this paper, we present empirical calculations that examine the efficiency of the classical IO model in reproducing price formation mechanisms and its potential to forecast inflation. The study attempted to reproduce the historical values of the consumer price index (CPI), based on the classic IO price model. We start with the price level at the base year and, by sequentially updating particular elements of the model, we obtain a sequence of theoretical CPIs, finally arriving at the actual CPI value of the next year. Differences in such calculated CPIs at each stage of this procedure can be interpreted as components of the overall forecast error. Each such component reflects a particular economic factor that influences inflation or formal (technical) discrepancies in processing the statistical data. From numerous variants of decomposition, we are trying to find a simple, convincing one with a clear economic meaning. We put special attention to widely discussed pass-through of import prices into domestic prices, which leads us to defining the “input–output pass-through”. The use of the method proposed below requires access to input–output tables expressed in current prices as well as in prices from the previous year. The use of tables in constant and current prices was analyzed in Dietzenbacher and Temurshoev (2012). This study focused on identifying differences in the results obtained for the same variables for Denmark data set between 2000 and 2007. Such tables are published more and more often, but at present there are very few cases where they constitute appropriate time series. Statistics Denmark is a notable exception, so we decided to base our empirical example on data made publicly available by this institution.",5

Trade liberalization measures, privatization policies and technological changes in the sector were the main factors influencing the rapid expansion of telecommunications, which consequently changed the structure of global trade and production (Inklaar and Timmer 2007; Lam and Shiu 2010; Los et al. 2015; Silva and Perobelli 2018). New technologies with satellite development, fiber optics, digital electronic circuits, mobile technology and the Internet have enabled, facilitated and expanded communication and information exchange. These technological advances thus narrowed time horizons and increased the spatial coverage of public and private decision-making, favoring the global fragmentation of productive processesFootnote 1 and the commercial and productive integration of world’s major economies (Athreye and Cantwell 2007; Krammer 2014). A mutual relationship emerges, that is, while telecommunications services with their new technologies intensify productive fragmentation around the world, they are also shaped by increasing productive globalization and expanding international trade. In this new world order with a fast rhythm of change, fluctuations in the levels of primary factor productivity and productive efficiency in telecommunications activity began to influence the relative competitive trends of the economic regions in the international trade. Since the 1990s, the spread of mobile telecommunications services has improved the sector’s efficiency and productivity, and has also attracted private investment (domestic and foreign investment) to the telecommunications sector (Vijselaar and Albers 2004; Ida and Kuroda 2009). The development of mobile telecommunications has become an important driving force of global economic growth in recent years (Lam and Shiu 2010; Chakraborty and Nandi 2011). In a contemporary period, the 5.0 or 4.0 technologies digital have adapted to the needs of manufacturing industries (a new industrial stage), offering patterns such as smart manufacturing, smart products, smart supply chain and smart working, internet of things, cloud services, big data and analytics (Frank et al. 2019). For these reasons, developed and developing countries have been directing policy instruments that can promote the expansion and modernization of telecommunications in the national territory (Dvornik and Sabolić 2007; Pradhan et al. 2017). The world began to see information taking place in a similar way to energy as an important input in the face of the advances and diffusion of microelectronics and telecommunications technologies (Werthein 2000). In general, post-reform telecommunications growth in many countriesFootnote 2 may have changed the regional composition of the global supply of this type of service, but there are doubts about variations in their sectorial productivity. The results of empirical studies, although they may capture the relationship between telecommunications and economic growth (Gruber 2001; Inklaar and Timmer 2007; Lam and Shiu 2010; Nadiri et al. 2018), and the reforms’ effects on sector productivity in many countries (Vijselaar and Albers 2004; Inklaar and Timmer 2007), do not point to the reasons why variations in telecommunications productivity occur within certain world economic systems, especially in terms of productive efficiency and primary factor productivity in recent years. After the reform period, some studies seek to measure fluctuations in the sector’s total factor productivity (TFP) for several countries using a partial equilibrium approach (Resende 2008; Kang 2009). However, analysis of these applied research do not take into account the domestic and imported input purchasing relationships in the sector cost structure in an interdependent system of world regions, which are asymmetric and changeable over the years with different stages of development. Moreover, these applied studies do not point to the relative importance of telecommunications in the productions of world’s major economies, especially when it is exploited through the direct and indirect channels of international production and trade links established in economic systems. In other words, little is known of the global and regional dependence on the supply and demand of telecommunications activity in an increasingly globalized world integrated with changing patterns of trade and production. It is expected that with the growth of telecommunications and changes in its regional composition of supply in the world, in addition to changes in production structures and international trade, this dependence on the sector has changed and, in some cases, become more or less intensive. This paper fills these two central gaps, i.e., the study conducts a comparative analysis on telecommunications TFP and verifies the relative importance of the sector in the world and in Brazil, China, and main developed economies. To accomplish this task, we use TFP decomposition and hypothetical extraction techniques from interregional input−output matrices, available annually between 2000 and 2014, including the post-reform sector period. The analyses are performed for the eight largest telecommunications-producing economies. Moreover, the analysis does not focus on the companies and market composition of the telecommunications sector, but on a comparative analysis between the main economies of the world, including Brazil. In addition to this introductory section, this article is organized into five further sections. Section 2 briefly reviews previous research on telecommunications and economy. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, divided into two steps, sequentially addressing the two techniques of the input−output model. Section 4 discusses the results of TFP decomposition in world telecommunications and the relative importance of the sector considering differentiated production and trade patterns. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the final remarks, highlighting the main conclusive results.",

Wiryawan,Christian Otchia,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Decentralization of the government function can be best understood as the devolvement of decision-making from the central government to its lower tier-administration, as described by Litvack and Seddon (1999) in their Briefing Notes for the World Bank. This concept is supposed to bring Pareto growth efficiency according to early decentralization scholars (Tiebout 1956; Oates 1972). These first generation of theorists convinced decision-makers in developed countries and thus propagated a wave of decentralization movement in the 1980s. However, in many developing countries the route to a decentralized governance institution has a quite different context. Large democratic movement in Brazil and the Philippines in the mid-1980s has led to a more decentralized institutions in both countries (Oxhorn et al. 2004). Indonesia followed the same narrative where the centralized-authoritarian rule of then president Suharto met its end in 1998, provided a way for a more democratic bottom-up governance starting in 2001. Decentralization in Indonesia was part of the nationwide reformasiFootnote 1 program. This was done under the background of provincial discontent at around the time (Eaton et al. 2011), specifically in the resource-rich regions. Starting in 2001, provinces and cities/districts are assigned larger fiscal roles that include various governmental affairs excluding executive functions such as foreign and defense affairs. New provinces and cities were also established to meet this demand of a less-centralized state institution. Fiscal decentralization in Indonesia is complimented further with the introduction of direct local elections beginning in 2005. Figure 1 illustrates this change where the share of sub-national against general government spending increased dramatically from 2000 to 2003 during the early phase of decentralization, and then followed by a steady increase until 2017. Consequently, in principle, the sub-national governments are granted larger decision-making abilities. (Source: MoF (2020)) Indonesia’s fiscal decentralization share 2000–2019 However, it is important to notice that decentralization transition in Indonesia has not been smooth since the beginning. The transfer of authority from the central to the local government was done in a “big-bang” rush without much preparation and it was directed straight to the lowest level of government, districts and cities, bypassing the province (Nasution 2016). This ill-prepared decision created institutional problems ranging from corruption to the constant lack of capacity building at the local level as pointed out by various studies (Alfada 2019; Henderson and Kuncoro 2004; Kuncoro 2006; Mulyo 2015; Nasution 2016). Due to the lack of institutional quality at the local level in this first phase, Jakarta slowed down its pace of decentralization with the announcement of Law 32 in 2004. The law introduced the ‘concurrent affairs’ which allowed the active presence of the central government at the sub-national level. Following the law, regulations were set up and various central government’s agencies were re-established in provinces and cities. Some scholars perceived this as an effort to re-centralize political and administrative power (Rahmatunnisa 2015). In between the years, the government has also issued Law 28 on Local Tax that enabled local government to expand their tax base. This law has led to spiking numbers of local regulations in the following years. However, still this does not significantly increase local governments’ capacities especially at the district/city level. Instead, in 2014 Jakarta issued the new decentralization law that (1) maintain the concurrent role of the central government, and (2) provide larger responsibility to the province-level governments at the cost of relatively lower district governments’ role. Despite all the dynamics, in administrative and political sense Indonesia is now a very much decentralized state compared to Suharto’s ‘new order’ era. It is expected that this dynamic institutional change would bring substantial effect on the economic performance at the local level. Indonesia’s economic progress in the decades prior to this has been hailed as the ‘rising tiger’ due to its unprecedented high growth rate. The progression was largely sustained by the export-driven manufacturing sector, before it was deeply affected by the 1997 Asian crisis. In the subsequent years, the manufacturing share of total GDP had been constantly decreasing, as well as its manufacturing trade specialization (Tijaja and Faisal 2014). Few studies have explored the link between decentralization on economic development in Indonesia. Setiawan and Aritenang (2019) found a positive impact of decentralization on regional economic growth optimally after 3 years. This confirmed the research of Dartanto and Brodjonegoro (2003), done in the early years of decentralization. They found out that decentralization is positively correlated with local economic growth and the effect is higher in the eastern region. In discussing elite capture, a relevant issue that could affect development under decentralization, Chowdhury and Yamauchi (2010) revealed that village decentralization in Indonesia has not lead to elite capture but rather is representing community’s interests. Contrasting arguments on the impact exists, that highlighted the negative or non-discernible effects of decentralization on the economy (Lewis 2006; Pepinsky and Wihardja 2010; Kuncoro 2006). So far, however, it is still not known whether decentralization can foster industrial development at local level. Industrialization has been regarded as the key towards productive structural transformation in Indonesia and elsewhere (Kniivila 2007; Lin 2010; Otsubo and Otchia 2020). Developing countries employ industrial policy to be able to catch-up with the developed ones. The success of the Newly Industrialized Countries of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore is the famous case of this industrialization strategy by employing export-oriented approach. The same strategy employed by China, through its reform and opening-up (gaige kaifang) program in 1978 that paved the way towards an unprecedented sustained growth for multiple decades. Considering its importance in sustaining growth and promoting structural change, this paper seeks to fill the gap in explaining the impact of decentralization policy on industrial growth at the sub-national level, using Indonesia as the case study. We understand that theoretically, under neo-classical approach, investment serves as the main channel of industrial growth rather than government spending that, in a decentralized sense, is channelled through the local government. Therefore, we also consider the impact of investment; does higher local government spending expand or diminish investment’s effect on industrial growth? What is the possible underlying cause for the relationship to happen? The rest of this paper will discuss the literature review on decentralization in Sect. 2, then followed by data description and estimation strategy in Sect. 3. Results and discussion are presented in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 concludes my findings.",

The dimensions of the tables are reduced to 70 × 70, as we have eliminated the industry housing because of its many imputations, and also the fictitious household industry. The idea of dimensionality reduction, that is, the way to reduce the complexity in the modeling of an economy can be traced in the writings of the Physiocrats and their tableau économique, whose purpose was to mimic the operation of the entire economy by compressing it into three sectors. We do know that the tableau is essentially the prototype of a one (multipurpose) commodity world. A similar idea can be recognized in Ricardo’s corn model and certainly in Marx’s schemes of simple reproduction, where a single commodity functions both as a consumer and an investment good. This dual property of the commodity is derived from the uniform capital intensity of the two sectors (departments) of the economy. A similar idea could be identified in Samuelson’s (1962) parable production function also based on the production of a single commodity. Finally, in recent economic growth theory, we increasingly observe the case of models of a one-commodity world. In the works (Mariolis and Tsoulfidis 2018, Tsoulfidis 2021 and 2022) there has been an effort to stripe down the behavior of the entire economic system and compress it into a single hyper-industry through the application of the Schur and singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques (Meyer 2002, ch. 5). The rationale for the application of these techniques is the skew distribution of the economic system’s eigenvalues and the wide gap of the second from the maximal. The exponential falling pattern of the subdominant eigenvalues ensures that their effect on the economy is minimal and, therefore, for all practical purposes can be side-stepped. Similarly, using the principal components analysis (PCA), we separate the impact of the top two (at most three) eigenvalues, which is equivalent to saying that the movement of prices induced by changes in the rate of profit is curvilinear and the same is true with the wage rate of profit curves or what is the same factor price frontier. Such findings suggest that the distribution of eigenvalues is mainly responsible for the shape of the price–profit or wage–profit curves and that the first eigenvalue along with the second compress most of the information regulating the economic system’s motion leaving not much to be explained by the third or fourth eigenvalues (see Tsoulfidis 2021, ch. 6 and 2022). The remainder of the article continues as follows: Sect. 2 gives a brief description of the fundamentals of the PCA and its use in determining clusters in the economy. Subsequently it applies the PCA and contrasts the first principal component against the backward linkages of the industries. The k-means clustering technique is used to extract the optimal number of groups of industries followed by the Silhouette method to form the clusters of industries. Sect. 3 orders each of the industries in the form of a dendrogram and respective network. Finally, Sect. 4 summarizes and concludes with remarks about future directions of the research.",2

In reality, no aggregate economic shocks, including those from monetary policy actions, affect only national aggregates; they also impact regional economic activities. Since most nations are composed of diverse regions, the effects of aggregate economic shocks are not necessarily uniform across regions (Carlino and DeFina 1998). More importantly, a body of literature suggests that monetary policy rules that ignore information at the regional level may lead to welfare losses when there are asymmetries in the transmission mechanism (De Grauwe 2000; Gros and Hefeker 2002); in other words, such monetary policy might not be optimal. Optimal monetary policy is theoretically derived from the maximization problem of a representative agent’s welfare function. In practice, monetary policy targets the national consumer price index (CPI) inflation, that is, the growth rate of the cost of living for the “average” consumer. Indeed, empirical findings show evidence that supports the possibility that people in different parts of a country face some heterogeneity in price behavior. For instance, Cecchetti et al. (2002) use annual city-level data for 1918–1995 and find price divergences among 19 cities in the United States, attributed to transportation costs and differences in the speed of adjustment to supply shocks. Some studies also provide evidence on heterogeneous regional price behavior in Indonesia. Using CPI data across 82 cities in Indonesia, Jangam and Akram (2019) and Aginta (2020a) find that regional prices do not converge to a common path. They show that instead, city prices evolve in four convergence clubs. Similarly, Aginta (2020b) uses CPI data of the 34 Indonesian provinces and finds four convergence clubs of price dynamics across provinces. Such heterogeneity in regional price behaviors might lead to different responses to a common national policy shock and has potentially significant consequences for the implementation of monetary policy in Indonesia. Despite the evidence of regional price heterogeneity in Indonesia, little is known about the effects of monetary policy on regional inflation. To the best of our knowledge, only the study of Ridhwan et al. (2014) attempts to analyze the regional impacts of Indonesia’s monetary policy. They find two crucial regional features that significantly determine the regional effects of monetary policy: industrial structure (especially the share of the manufacturing industry) and firm and bank size. In the context of the Indonesian economy, these findings imply the significance of the interest rate and credit channels of monetary policy transmission. However, their study focuses on exploring the sources of variation in monetary policy impacts on regional output. In addition, their observations cover only 26 Indonesian provinces, and they apply a standard VAR model. Against this backdrop, our paper contributes to the existing literature in at least three ways. First, we scrutinize regional asymmetries of monetary policy transmission and the impact on regional inflation and evaluate the role of regional structural characteristics in these asymmetries. Our focus on analyzing regional inflation is consistent with the mandate of Indonesia’s central bank to maintain rupiah stability, reflected in inflation.Footnote 1 Given this mandate, it is crucial for the central bank to understand how the regional economic structure affects monetary policy transmission to the inflation rate in the entire archipelago. Second, we combine a standard structural vector autoregression (VAR) model with factor analysis into a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) to exploit a more extensive dataset. Unlike general VAR models, which might not capture the behavior of complex economic variables involved in the monetary transmission mechanism, the FAVAR model proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005) allows better identification of monetary policy shocks. Moreover, it enables the use of unlimited variables to proxy theoretical constructs and helps researchers eliminate the need to arbitrarily choose a specific variable to represent an economic concept. Third, we use a regional dataset on all 34 provinces in Indonesia.Footnote 2 In the first part of this paper, we measure the asymmetric effects of a common monetary policy shock in Indonesia on regional inflation. Based on the estimates from our province-level structural FAVAR, in the second part, we analyze the reasons for the differential responses to monetary policy. More specifically, we investigate the role of regional structural characteristics in the responses of regional inflation to monetary policy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methods and data.

(2020). Although there is insufficient evidence to agree on the origin of the crisis, one of the key factors is that the Chilean government has a poor effect on the market’s unequal income distribution. Figure 1 demonstrates that in 2017, the market income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was approximately 50 points, and government intervention reduced it to 47 points. This is in contrast to the redistributive effect in the majority of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, where government intervention reduces inequality by more than 10 points on average.Footnote 1 Disposable income Gini after and before government intervention 2017. Own elaboration based on the Income Distribution Database, OECD The government affects the distribution of income through a variety of instruments, which can be summed up as taxation, government intervention in markets, and public spending (Papadimitriou 2006; Osberg et al. 2004). This study examines the relationship between government fiscal expenditure and income distribution in Chile. To capture the direct and indirect effects of fiscal expenditures, we constructed the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for 2016 and employed a multiplier model to provide an analytical framework. The paper’s method and technique are complementary to the vast majority of literature on income distribution in Chile. The method is an additional perspective to the computable general equilibrium, partial equilibrium, and reduced-form models developed by Mardones (2010), Engel et al. (1999), and Urzua et al. (2014). The SAM organizes the flow of income at a meso-level, building a useful bridge between the macro and a more specific description of the institutions. The SAM illustrates the circular flow within the economy by depicting the generation of income by commodity-producing activities, the distribution of income to factor households, and the subsequent expenditure of income by households. Compared to other methods, the use of SAM income multipliers is based on two key assumptions (Rubio Sanz and Perdiz 2003). First, the agents lack a behavioral model, and second, there are no supply constraints. These assumptions simplify the functioning of the economy to highlight the income flows among the major agents and accounts of the economic system. The income multipliers of a SAM provide a framework for analyzing the redistributive impact of various exogenous income injections on the multisectoral structure of the economy, as described by Pyatt and Round (1977, 1979). De Miguel and Perez (2006) used a SAM for the economy of Extremadura, Spain, to study how exogenous injections affect income inequality, highlighting two results. First, increases in final demand have a negative impact on the poorest quintiles, thereby widening the inequality gap. Second, direct transfers from households with higher incomes to those with lower incomes narrow the inequality gap. Reich (2018) utilized the SAMs as the statistical foundation to extend the techniques of Input–Output analysis from the realm of product transactions to the realm of income transactions, explaining the composition of primary income (wages, profits, and taxes) contained in the disposable income of any institutional sector of the economy. He applied the method to Canada, Germany, and Portugal to illustrate the disparities in income distribution between economies. Using the SAM of the Vietnamese economy, Civardi et al. (2010) showed that there are characteristics of the system that favor the accumulation of income by a certain group of people. Therefore, some policies intended to benefit the poorest may end up enhancing the condition of middle- and high-income households. They found that policies focused on the agricultural sector will have a greater effect on reducing income inequality. Most of the research on the effects of the Chilean government on income inequality has focused on taxation. For instance, Mardones (2010) employed a model of general equilibrium to demonstrate that a 20% reduction in the value-added tax (VAT) rate and a 40% increase in the income tax for households in the highest income quintile would produce only modest improvements in poverty and income distribution. Moreover, Engel et al. (1999) indicated that, between increasing the progressivity of a progressive tax in collection, such as the income tax, and increasing a regressive tax rate, such as VAT, the second option may end up being more beneficial to low-income sectors because the latter collects a greater proportion of income from higher-income households. Martinez-Aguilar et al. (2018) provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of fiscal policy in Chile using the method proposed by the Commitment to Equity Institute and outlined in Lustig and Higgins (2013). The authors provide evidence that Chile’s fiscal system is characterized by regressive but equalizing indirect taxes. This counterintuitive result occurs because indirect taxes have a greater equalizing effect than progressive direct taxes and direct transfers. This study adds a new perspective to the analysis of government effects on the income distribution in Chile by examining the circuits of income flows triggered by government spending. The results indicate that when government spending flows through the entire payment system of the economy, it ultimately benefits the highest income quintiles in nominal terms. Comparing what households receive from fiscal expenditures to their share of total income reveals that fiscal expenditures are regressive for the wealthiest quintile. Using two counterfactual scenarios, we proposed that fiscal expenditure could be more progressive if the distribution of factor payments was to become more progressive. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the multipliers model. Section 3 explains how the SAM 2016 for the Chilean economy was calculated, describing the primary information sources used in its preparation. Section 4 applies the analysis of multipliers with the SAM and develops the two counterfactual experiments. Section 5 discusses the limitations of the results. Finally, Sect. 6 provides a summary of the main conclusions.",

In this regard, the policies of government and the national and international organizations play important role in the development of globalization. Many developing and developed countries have been following the economic policies of liberalization. Quite a few countries have made effort to decrease trade restrictions via entering in multiple regional and international trading agreements. Arrangements are being made to reduce the barriers on trade and capital flows. In this regard, financial deregulation was primarily started by developed countries in the 1970s, whereas it initiated in developing countries during the 1980s. The surge of globalization is complemented by technological advancement that has transformed the national companies into transnational to earn more profit in the newly developed global markets. It has resulted in higher integrated economies in economic, financial, political, social and cultural relations. However, the policies of deregulation do not necessarily guarantee the perks of globalization. Several economies are enjoying substantial economic growth due to globalization, while others are not able to reap its benefits. It is, therefore, challenging to draw some firm conclusions concerning the impact of globalization on economic and social performance of a country. The possible reasoning could be heterogeneity in the structure and policies of different countries which critically dependent on an inspection of economic, financial, political, social and cultural practices of a society. Furthermore, the advantage of opening the border greatly depends on absorption capacity, human resource and institutions of the country under consideration. Globalization offers multiple channels for development and growth and at the same time it imposes challenges in managing and formulating domestic policies. Income, unemployment, poverty reduction and economic inequality have always been the major objectives of policy makers. Along with these objectives, social performance of a country is also a concern of policy makers. Globalization identifies modernized link to socioeconomic and political processes that effect and are affected by the events in communities. Providing basic necessities and better quality of life is always on the top of the policies that reflected in good governance but these objectives are not easy to achieve. There is always a cruel choice among the economic and social goals of development. It is argued that these indicators can get worse if government’s strategies are insensitive to the implication of such polices in the age of global interdependencies. Despite this fact, the effective policy can serve as a locomotive to achieve these goals simultaneously. In this regard, economic growth serves as engine in attaining other social goals. It is suggested that socio-economic sustainability can be achieved by adopting the Rawalsian justice principle in the formulation of economic and financial strategies (Rao and Molina 2015). High and persistent unemployment increases social discontent (related to inequality and widespread poverty), which is driven by various economic, social and psychological mechanisms. Unemployment is linked not only to greater poverty, but also to greater inequality as the unemployed individuals lose proportionately more than the employed individuals (Nickell 1990). Subsequently, it affects human welfare. Countries with persistent problem of unemployment, poverty and inequality perform poor in the ranking of Human Development Index (HDI). Therefore, it can be concluded that the socioeconomic variables are linked with each other in one way or the other. Furthermore, economic, political and social interdependence of countries is also influencing these indicators directly or indirectly. The effect of globalization on socioeconomic variables has been one of the debated issues not only among researchers but also masses. The spread of globalization is heterogeneous as some regions are more globalized, while others are not. The global economy does not mean to encompass the whole globe rather; it involves only certain sections in both developing and developed countries. Hence, the impact of globalization is not uniform in all states. Some studies show the convergence of socioeconomic factors among different regions, while others show divergence. An unsettled controversy regarding the consequences of globalization is found in literature. Some studies show favorable impact of globalization on income, unemployment, poverty, inequality and HDI (Dollar 1992; Dreher 2006; Sapkota 2010; Dogan 2013; Lee 2014; Siddiqa et al. 2018), while others observe negative and weak influence on these indicators (Rodriguez and Rodrik 2000; Umaru et al. 2013; Furusawa et al. 2020). Reviewing the existing literature, one observes the following finding. First, most of the empirical evidence shows relationship between globalization and one or two socioeconomic indicator using economic or financial proxies of globalization. Studies with the comprehensive index of globalization also focus on single dimension of socioeconomic status and most importantly literature seems to be missing regarding the impact of globalization on socioeconomic index, expect for HDI. However, it is also subject to criticism for considering only few indicators (Murray 1993 and Srinivasan 1994). Second, most of the empirical literature do not allow cross-sectional dependence, despite that there is economic, financial, political and social interdependence among countries and regions in the modern era of globalization. Now-a-days international dependence is said to be strong, especially with reference to commerce and finance. For instance, the monetary policies of financial Centre countries have huge spillover effect on smaller economics due to globally integrated financial system, which consequently influences the related indicators of nation states. These shortcomings motivate us to explore the linkages among different types of globalization (economic, social and political) and socioeconomic variables (poverty, inequality, unemployment and HDI) by applying the recent econometric techniques and procedures. The goal of current study is to investigate the association among economic, political and social globalization and the relationship of these types of globalization with selected socioeconomic variables. The conclusion will provide an insight to comprehend the causal connection among different types of globalization and socioeconomic variables. For this purpose, the panel data set of 129 countries from the period of 1990 to 2019 is analyzed. Moreover, second generation econometric procedures are employed to consider cross-sectional dependence of macroeconomic variables, which is neglected in most of the empirical finding of globalization studies. The analysis carried is an effort to empirically test the relationship between three types of globalizations, as how economic, political and social globalizations are linked to one another. Furthermore, the study of possible effects of globalization on poverty, inequality, unemployment and HDI and the reverse causation distinguishes the current study from previous literature. Several studies have shown the impact of globalization on various indicators but none of the previous studies have attempted to explain how poverty, inequality, unemployment and human welfare affect the density of economic, political and social interdependence among countries. Relational behavior of human development index is also explored to three types of globalization to examine which dimension of globalization is powerful in affecting the overall socioeconomic performance of a country. Specifically, the aims of the study are as follows. First, it investigates the relationship among three categories of globalization and socio-economic indicators. Second, it examines the inter-link between socio-economic indicators in the presence of economic, political and social globalization. Third, short run and long run impact of globalization on selected socio-economic indicators.",

The Protocol imposed an obligation on Japan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% by 2012 compared to its 1990 level. This reduction target, however, was not achieved by that deadline. Energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased from 1068 million tons in 1990 to 1227 million tons in 2012, and the manufacturing sector, which is the main source of emissions, accounted for 25–33% of these emissions during this period.Footnote 1 Cooperation with manufacturing companies is indispensable to cut CO2 emissions, and environmental operations are inevitable because they are expected to address the issue of global warming as part of their corporate social responsibility (Managi and Kuriyama 2017, pp. 164–170). Introducing cleaner production approaches can help decrease CO2 emissions. Cleaner production aims to reduce the burden on the environment in all production processes, from the input of raw materials to the output and disposal of products (Managi and Kuriyama 2017, pp. 206–207). Since the enforcement of the Protocol, the approach has become more widespread in Japanese firms. As a result, manufacturing companies may have promoted a review of energy use, such as using clean energy, adopting energy-saving technology, and recycling energy. Companies have an inherent incentive to improve energy performance, which is defined as energy use per unit of production, even in a situation that has not introduced cleaner production approaches. This is because it has the potential to reduce production costs through energy savings. However, in a situation where cleaner production is required to reduce CO2 emissions, energy performance may not improve as expected immediately. This is due to the possibility that all production methods are reviewed considering long-term investments. Ideally, it is desirable for the companies that energy use remains the most efficient in either situation, considering it with and without pollution abatement. The first objective of our study is to apply a new indicator of energy performance, considering the aforementioned situations in subnational (prefectural) scope. We refer to this new indicator as environmental energy efficiency (EEE), which has been employed at a multinational but regional level to date (Zhou and Ang 2008; Rakshit and Mandal 2020). Besides, our EEE takes a ratio to create an EEE index; this is different from previous studies. This indicator is an application of environmental efficiency proposed by Färe et al. (1996) and Kumar and Khanna (2009), which is measured by data envelopment analysis (DEA) using a distance function approach. For the period between 1990 and 2012, which was the framework for the Kyoto Protocol, we evaluate whether efficient use of energy and CO2 emissions control has progressed by measuring the EEE of each prefecture in Japan. We focus on measuring the EEE of manufacturing industries because they are the main sources of CO2 emissions. This study extracts seven industries from the manufacturing sector, in addition to the entire manufacturing industry, and provides policymakers with detailed information about industry-wise trends of energy performance in Japan. Further, it is necessary to analyze the influencing factors of EEE to derive useful policy guidelines. The second objective of our study is to estimate EEE factors using a panel data analysis for the period of 1990–2012. We demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between EEE and three factors: economic development, industrial structure, and technological progress. This study investigates the influencing factors using a pooled mean group (PMG) estimator based on the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach of Pesaran et al. (1999) while simultaneously considering the problems of cross-sectional dependence, unit roots, and cointegration in the panels. We ultimately propose appropriate environmental energy strategies for policymakers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” Section presents a brief literature review and the contributions of our study. “Measuring environmental energy efficiency” Section provides the measurement method of EEE, including the data used and the measurement results. “Panel data analysis” Section explains our panel data models, applied panel data, and reports the estimation results. “Conclusion” Section summarizes our empirical results and suggests directions for environmental energy policies in Japan.",
