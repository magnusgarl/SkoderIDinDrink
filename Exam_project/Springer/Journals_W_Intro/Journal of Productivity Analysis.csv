Timmer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Most sectoral productivity studies have focused on firms or industries in the manufacturing sector. Recently, there is increased attention for service industries, in particular the distributive (wholesale and retail) trade sector. The main reason is that performance in the trade sector is one of the main drivers of the US growth acceleration in the 1990s (Jorgenson et al. 2005; Triplett and Bosworth 2004). Moreover, over half of the economy-wide labor productivity growth leads of the US over Europe after 1995 can be traced to strong US performance in trade (van Ark et al. 2003). Various studies have discussed the reasons for superior performance in the US trade industry. Most focused on the role of ICT as a source of productivity growth and stress Europe’s lagging behind in ICT investment and accompanying organizational changes. Others stress the restrictive European regulations concerning for example zoning and labor markets, and cultural differences (McGuckin et al. 2005; Gordon 2004). In this paper we take one step back and raise the more down-to-earth question whether superior US productivity growth is real, or due to inadequate measurement. The latter possibility has been suggested by a recent report of the European Commission (2004) and was also raised by Gordon (2004). Both stress the statistical problems with measures of productivity in trade sectors and argue for a critical assessment of the way in which volume measures of trade output are being calculated. The European Commission report claims that the contribution of trade sectors to the US productivity boom is substantially overestimated. Despite some useful clues from recent studies on US measurement of retail service output (Triplett and Bosworth 2004; Manser 2005) this subject has not been investigated in-depth in an internationally comparative perspective. In this paper we argue that national accounts data are becoming more and more obsolete, due to organizational changes in retail, and suffer increasingly from comparability problems, due to statistical measurement innovations. The key problem is that in current National Accounts methodology, changes in prices of the most important input in retail trade, namely the purchases of goods for resale, are not accounted for. We outline a consistent accounting framework for measuring trade sector productivity and illustrate this with alternative measures of trade productivity in the US and four major European countries. The failure to account for changes in purchases prices is becoming more pressing for two reasons. First, changes in the business models of retailers are changing the demarcation between activities of traders, manufacturers and customers. Triplett and Bosworth (2004) provide a simple example regarding the sale of bicycles, which once were delivered to the retailer fully assembled. Now they typically arrive in a box, and customers can choose between having the store arrange for assembly and doing it themselves. Failure to account for differences in purchase prices can lead to misstated growth if certain activities are shifted between stores and suppliers (Triplett and Bosworth 2004; Manser 2005). The second reason is that the use of quality-adjusted prices for deflation of goods sold and the lack of deflation of goods purchased, may lead to a bias in productivity growth in the trade sector. This is similar to the point stressed by Triplett (1996) in his study of productivity growth rates in computer manufacturing. Given that the use of quality-adjusted prices by statistical offices is rapidly increasing, this problem is becoming more important. Presently, it appears most visible in measurement of computer sales. For example, nominal sales of electronics stores grew on average at 5% per year in the US during 1995–2002. The prices of these products, about half of which are computers, declined on average at an annual rate of 12% as measured by quality-adjusted price indices. As a result, sales volume grew by a phenomenal 17% annually. In the national accounts, margin volumes are assumed to grow at the same 17% rate. However, the purchasers’ prices of these computers will have declined substantially as well, so as Triplett (1996) argued, quality changes should be accounted for consistently throughout the productivity measurement framework. How this affects the comparability of productivity estimates across countries is still a black box, and has not gone much beyond speculations so far. In this paper we will provide a first attempt to quantify the magnitude of these measurement issues for international comparisons of productivity in retail trade industries.Footnote 1
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we lay out a conceptual framework for measures of productivity in trade industries based on a neo-classical model of production and various concepts of output: sales, margins and value added. It is shown that multifactor productivity measures based on the various output concepts differ only by a scaling factor, which is proportional to the share of value added and margin in sales. However, this is only true when all inputs are deflated with appropriate price indices. This is not the case in standard national accounting. In Sect. 3, we discuss the scope of the comparability problem for retail output and productivity measures between the US and Europe. In Sect. 4, the measurement problem is dealt with more directly by estimating double deflated margin volume measures. We provide an experimental approach to measure trade margins in constant prices, by estimating prices for both sales and purchases of goods sold. This is done for the US and four large European countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In Sect.5 international comparisons of multifactor productivity are made, based on our internationally harmonized measures of trade output and inputs. Our main findings are first, that improved measures of retail trade output and productivity are feasible and second, that US productivity growth in the retail trade sector since the mid 1990s is well above continental European growth rates, and on par with growth rates in the UK. Section 6 concludes.",21

The existence, dimension, and size of spillover effects are generally believed to depend on three categories of determinants: (1) multinational company and foreign affiliate characteristics, (2) local firm and economy characteristics and (3) institutional parameters, e.g. intellectual property rights, infrastructure, etc. (Table 1).
 Previous studies showed that host country conditions are crucial in determining the behavior of foreign firms (Kokko 1994). The level of competition, presence of educated human resources (Blomstrom et al. 1995; Sjoholm 1999), the gap between the productivity of foreign and domestic firms (Wang and Blomström 1992; Perez 1997), infrastructure (Kinoshita 2001) and the institutional set up for intellectual property right protection (Smarzynska Javorcik 2004b) are among the most important host country characteristics identified in the literature. Although they do not show a clear-cut, systematic pattern, most recent studies on developed countries find positive evidence of spillover effect from foreign companies’ presence (Haskel et al. 2002; Keller and Yeaple 2003), while studies on developing countries find negative or no spillover effects (Aitken and Harrison 1999; Blomstrom and Sjoholm 1999). Transition economies are distinct from both groups of countries and characterized by relatively developed human capital but poor infrastructure and weak market institutions. The relative abundance of human capital, which sets the transitions economies apart from developing countries at large, is likely to promote learning and spillovers of knowledge from foreign to local firms. However, human capital alone may not be sufficient for positive spillover effects to take place. As Kogut and Zander (1993) put it, “… multinational corporation arises not out of the failure of markets for the buying and selling of knowledge but out of its superior efficiency as an organizational vehicle by which to transfer this knowledge across borders”. However, intra-MNC technology transfer costs “derived from the efforts to codify and teach complex knowledge to recipient” (Kogut and Zander 1993) are usually underestimated and likely to be substantial (Teece 1981). In transition economies low levels of competition and weak intellectual property protection regimes amplify the cost of knowledge transfers and reduce the motivation of foreign firms to transfer technologies in high-tech industries. However, in the new market-oriented environment, it has not been easy to efficiently utilize the resources accumulated before transition by technologically intensive domestic firms. Some studies suggest that slow privatization is one of the factors that has caused inefficiency in the transition economies in general, and in high-tech industries in particular (Adamchik and Bedi 2000). The planned economy era left many outdated institutions in its wake, mutually embodied in organizations and ‘rules of the game’ (North 1990). The attitude of traditional domestic firms to the competitive pressures exerted by foreign firms, and therefore the impact of foreign presence, is largely determined by the degree of adjustment or reform of the institutional framework. Unfortunately, assessing the quality and impact of a country’s institutions poses formidable methodological challenges: there is no readily available way to quantify and measure such variables empirically. Empirical studies on spillover effects in transition economies are not numerous, and those that exist provide divergent results. Djankov and Hoekman (2000) find a statistically significant negative intra-industry spillover effect of foreign participation on domestic firms in the Czech Republic from 1992 to 1996. This finding is consistent with the results found by Konings (2001) investigating Bulgaria and Romania, where foreign firms on average do not even perform better than their domestic counterparts. By contrast, in Poland foreign firms are more productive than domestic firms, but no evidence of spillover effects to domestic firms is found. Various studies looking at determinants of FDI spillovers other than horizontal linkages in transition economies come up with contrasting results. Yudaeva et al. (2003) find that, in Russia, the stock of human capital in regions where foreign firms operate is one of the factors that help domestic firms to benefit from the entry of foreign firms. They also find that there are positive spillovers from foreign-owned firms to domestic firms in the same industry but negative effects on domestic firms that are vertically related to foreign-owned firms. The opposite holds for Lithuania (Smarzynska Javorcik 2004a). Here positive productivity spillovers from FDI taking place through contacts between foreign affiliates and their local suppliers in upstream sectors, while horizontal spillovers are insignificant. Mode of entry is also found to be important: spillovers are associated with projects with shared domestic and foreign ownership but not with fully owned foreign investments. Sinani and Meyer (2004) look at the role of size, trade orientation and ownership structure of domestic firms in Estonia in determining spillover effects from technology transfers from abroad. Finding a positive spillover effect of significant magnitude, they conclude that small, non-exporting and outsider-owned firms benefit more from spillovers than do other types of domestic firms. While the quality of the data, identified determinants and conclusions on FDI spillovers are diverse, the methodology used in these studies varies little. This study holds that some of the difficulties in capturing spillover effects econometrically may lie in the methodology commonly employed to measure the performance of firms. The most accepted approach to measure spillover effect is the parametric estimation of production functions (largely Cobb-Douglas functions) with different proxies added to capture the spillover effect. The favored proxy is the foreign share of production, employment, or capital, as in Caves (1974) and Blomström, Haddad and Harrison (1993). However, finding a correlation between the foreign share of an industry and the productivity level or growth rate of domestic firms does not prove spillovers: the causal links are unclear and there may be endogeneity problems. These two main problems have been tackled differently in different econometric studies on spillovers. Spillovers were identified not merely by foreign share, but by correlation with the presence of multinationals in downstream sectors or upstream industries, namely vertical and horizontal spillovers (Smarzynska Javorcik 2004a). Different tools were employed to control for fixed and random effects (Konings 2001), and the semi parametric estimation method suggested by Olley and Pakes (1996) was implemented to account for endogeneity of input demand and corrected to take into account the fact that the measures of potential spillovers are industry specific while the observations in the data set are at the firm level (Smarzynska Javorcik 2004a). The parametric techniques used in these studies are based on the assumption that all firms in the sample are efficient. Efficiency and scale are usually held constant so a change in TFP reflects a corresponding change in technology. Yet, in reality, productivity varies as a result of differences in production technology, differences in the technical efficiency of the organization, and the external operating environment in which production occurs. To the best of our knowledge, Hirschberg and Lloyd (2002) was the first spillover study attempting to take this into account, although their methodology was dubious as discussed by Simar and Wilson (2007). Here, we use the Simar and Wilson (2007) approach in the second stage bootstrap procedure (see Sect. 4 for more details on methodology). Efficiency is viewed as the best indicator reflecting the influence of foreign presence in transition economies. This is due to the assumption that organizational knowledge of foreign firms is superior to the state of existing knowledge of domestic firms, which used to operate in planned economy. This knowledge is not always tacit and can easier spill over to domestic firms, in contrast to codified knowledge on technology that may be well protected by patents and licenses. The possibility for cross country comparison with DEA models was first proposed by Caves et al. (1982) “allowing utilities from different countries to support the DEA envelope” and applied in a number of recent studies, including Kumar and Russell (2002), Edvardsen and Forsund (2003), Jamasb and Pollitt (2001). International comparisons are often restricted to comparison of operating costs because of the heterogeneity of input costs. As a precondition for international comparisons they focus on improving the quality of the data collection process, auditing, and standardization within and across countries. Our data were taken from international standard accounting reports made by companies at the end of each year. This source has been used by other authors for cross-countries comparison—see Konings (2001) and Damijan et al. (2003).",18

Debreu (1951) measured the utilization of resources and Solow (1957) measured technical change, but their models are remote. Solow’s model is macro-economic and assumes perfect competition, while Debreu’s model is micro-economic and assumes no technical change. In this paper, I show how the measures of Debreu and Solow can be commingled into TFP. I take Debreu’s model as point of departure, because it is quite general and, therefore, accommodating. The drawback of Debreu’s coefficient of resource utilization, however, is that it hinges on individual preferences data. I will free his coefficient from this prohibitive data requirement, by making Debreu’s concept of a ‘better’ commodity set independent of the specifics of individual preferences. The procedure will be shown to be equivalent to the adoption of Leontief preferences, confirming Diewert’s (1983) idea that such preferences remove misallocations between consumers as a source of inefficiency. The consequent coefficient of resource utilization yields a more conservative estimate of inefficiency than Debreu’s coefficient resource of utilization. As a bonus, the procedure makes the measure of inefficiency a function of total consumption only, not the individual breakdown. This paves the way for macro-economic applications and Solow residual analysis. The Solow residual is generalized to Debreu’s setting. Neoclassical economics encounters some refreshing competition from frontier analysis. See Nishimizu and Page (1982), Färe et al. (1994), Färe and Grosskopf (1996), Kumar and Russell (2002) and the references given there. This literature provides a useful decomposition of productivity growth into technical change and efficiency change. I take the idea into the neoclassical general equilibrium realm. The connection is at a rather abstract level, for the mechanisms behind efficiency change are different in frontier analysis and neoclassical economics. Frontier analysis captures technological catch-up with the leader and the choice of inputs in terms of costs. Neoclassical analysis captures potential reallocations of resources between sectors. This type of efficiency change is harder to detect. Frontier analytic inefficiency is exposed by the gap with the best practice, a conceptually straightforward concept. Neoclassical inefficiency, however, not only comprises gaps with production possibility frontiers, but also hidden misallocations. A nice exposition is Debreu (1951) and Diewert (2001) discusses the reduction to TFP. A contribution of my paper is that it shows how the tools of frontier analysis, particularly the input- and output-distance functions, can be applied to the measurement of allocative efficiency. The pieces of the puzzle fit pleasingly well. More precisely, in this paper I show that TFP growth is the sum of technical change and efficiency change, where the former is the (generalized) Solow residual and the latter is the rate of growth of the modified coefficient of resource utilization.",22

G. den Butter,Jan L. Möhlmann,Paul Wit,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In modern growth theory productivity improvements are measured by the increase of total factor productivity (TFP). TFP forms the part in the increase of production in the production function that can not be explained by capital and labour inputs. Mostly innovations and technical change are thought of as contributors to TFP. Technical innovations are also the primary focus of the Lisbon Strategy. This strategy was agreed upon by the member states of the European Union (EU) in 2000 in order to make the EU “the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world” by 2010. One of the methods of achieving this is by spending at least 3% of the income on research and development (R&D). Empirical research on productivity growth has also focused mainly on R&D and human capital formation. However, there exists an alternative factor that could explain productivity growth: transaction costs. Lowering these costs leads to further specialisation and division of labour and consequently to productivity growth. This study shows that innovations lowering transaction costs might even explain TFP better than R&D stock does in The Netherlands. Although most economists recognise the importance of transaction costs, there is not much empirical evidence in the literature on the contribution of innovations that lower transaction costs (which we label trade innovations) to TFP. Data on R&D only partially capture trade innovations and mainly measure innovations which directly enhance the efficiency of production (which we label product innovations). A reason for the lack of studies that explicitly study the contribution of trade innovations to TFP is that transaction costs and innovations lowering these costs are difficult to measure. This paper tries to deal with this measurement problem by using the difference in the growth of trade and the growth of output as a proxy for trade innovations (TI). The implicit assumption is that without trade innovations, the costs of trading would not decrease and the growth of trade would be equal to output growth. We use this proxy in order to answer the following research questions: (i) How much do trade innovations and R&D contribute to TFP in The Netherlands? (ii) Are trade innovations contributing more to TFP than investments in R&D in The Netherlands? (iii) Should innovations lowering transaction costs be incorporated in the Lisbon Strategy? The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section shortly describes the concepts of TFP, R&D expenditure and transactions costs from the perspectives of economic growth theory and transaction costs economics. It gives an overview of the existing empirical research on the impact of R&D and human capital formation on economic growth and productivity. Moreover, some theoretical arguments are given for government intervention. Section 3 discusses the data used in the empirical analysis. The specification and the results of the empirical analysis are presented in Sect. 4. It focuses on The Netherlands because we expect trade innovations to play an important role in this country. The Netherlands is regarded as a ‘nation of traders’, where distribution, financing, marketing and services are important sectors in the economy (see e.g. WRR 2003; Van Dalen and Van Vuuren 2005). We conduct a regression analysis on time-series data for the 1950–1992 period. Although the outcome of the regression results is mixed, it suggests that trade innovations have become more important for TFP than product innovations. Section 5 concludes and considers the implications of the analysis for the Lisbon Strategy. When trade innovations play a major role, which appears to be the case in The Netherlands, the exclusive focus of the Lisbon Strategy on R&D expenditures is less warranted. The differences of orientation between EU countries as transaction economies are also an argument against the ‘one size fits all’ approach of the Lisbon Strategy.",5

T. Blank,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cost function estimation is one of the most popular approaches to analyzing a firm’s productivity and efficiency, particularly in public service provision. There are innumerable examples of cost function applications (see e.g., the number of references in Blank 2000). A cost function is a dual representation of a production technology. Under the assumption of cost-minimizing behavior at given service levels and resource prices, it provides a mathematical relationship between actual costs on the one hand, and exogenous service levels and resource prices on the other. However, it is questionable whether the cost function approach provides a sufficiently realistic representation of actual economic behavior and the economic context in which it occurs. In many public service industries, firms are constrained by a (cost) budget rather than by service levels. There is also sizeable body of literature suggesting that public service firms have motives other than minimizing costs or maximizing profits. Cost-constrained technologies can be represented by a cost indirect output distance (CIOD) function. This cost indirect output distance function represents the largest factor by which service levels can be improved without the cost involved exceeding a given budget. It is a multiple output version of the well-known production function. The CIOD has only been applied in limited empirical research (see e.g., Grosskopf et al.
1997; Hayes et al.
1998; Blank and Merkies 2004). Since the CIOD requires the same type of data as a cost function, it is not clear why this approach has not been applied more widely. Since the late 1980s, a number of authors have proposed non-cost minimizing behavior, input preference and bureaucratic models (Eakin and Kniesner 1988; Dor et al.
1997; Eakin 1993; Atkinson and Cornwell 1994; Kumbhakar 1997; Maietta 2000; Atkinson and Primont 2002). They all suggest using a shadow cost function, expressed in terms of exogenous service levels and shadow resource prices. Shadow resource prices (internal to the firm) may differ from actual prices. It is assumed that firms minimize (shadow) cost on the basis of these shadow prices. Shadow cost and shadow resource prices are expressed in terms of actual resource prices and actual cost shares and can be estimated. In fact, the goal of the model is the set of (shadow) resource prices that best fits the actual cost and cost shares under the minimizing-cost assumption. Based on the principle of shadow pricing, Rodrigues-Alvarez and Lovell (2004) derive a system consisting of an input distance function and corresponding resource demand equations. They estimate the structural under- or over-utilization (expense preference) by estimating an extra intercept in each of the resource demand equations. Although the CIOD satisfies the cost constraint rather than service-level constraints, it still fails to take the input preference behavior into account. The shadow cost function (SCF), on the other hand, deals with the input preference behavior but fails when it comes to cost constraint. The approach proposed by Rodrigues-Alvarez and Lovell (2004) has another limitation. Their approach breaks the direct relationship between the input distance function and the resource demand equations. The result of this is that any relationship between the under- and over-utilization of resource quantities and firm size, relative input prices and fixed capital is ignored. Potential structural misallocations are assumed to be constant across firms and independent of the characteristics of a firm. In this paper, I suggest combining the cost-constrained technology approach and the shadow-cost approach by deriving a Shadow Cost Indirect Output Distance Function (SCIOD). This paper will derive an exact relationship between services delivered, actual cost, actual cost shares and actual resource prices. This approach also provides separate measures for technical and allocative inefficiencies in a straightforward manner. In the limited number of studies relating to the CIOD approach, this decomposition has been neglected. In Sect. 2 I will discuss some of the theoretical issues relating to the CIOD and the SCIOD. Mathematical expressions for the SCIOD and the corresponding resource-demand equations are derived. The expressions for the ray output elasticity and marginal cost are also presented. In Sect. 3, a complete system for the SCIOD based on a translog function is derived, consisting of the indirect output distance function and corresponding resource-demand equations. Section 4 includes some comments on the estimation procedure. The conclusions follow in Sect. 5.",4

C. A. Henning,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The analysis of technical efficiency is a widely used tool in empirical production studies. It is generally based on a “frontier” production function that represents the maximum output quantities attainable from each set of input quantities (Coelli et al. 2005). This methodology accounts for the fact that not all producers succeed in optimizing their production processes and might not achieve the maximum output level given their input quantities. It is often used to explore and compare the (relative) efficiencies of different producers and to determine factors that influence the producer’s efficiency. Microeconomic theory implies that production functions should monotonically increase in all inputs. The importance of theoretical consistency in frontier analysis has been already stressed by Sauer et al. (2006). We show that the monotonicity property is particularly important for estimating the (relative) efficiencies of individual firms because otherwise a reasonable interpretation of the results is impossible (see also O’Donnell and Coelli 2005). The non-parametric non-stochastic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) implicitly imposes monotonicity while the parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) with flexible functional forms generally disregards this condition. Many empirical applications of SFA present results in which the monotonicity condition is not fulfilled, despite its importance (Sauer et al. 2006). Although procedures for imposing monotonicity of frontier functions have been proposed in the literature, they are rarely used
Footnote 1—probably because these procedures are rather complex and laborious. Therefore, we present a new three-step procedure that is much simpler and can be used also by practitioners.

Kumbhakar,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Given the key role of banks as financial intermediaries in the process of transformation from a planned to a market economy, empirical assessment of efficiency of banking institutions in former socialist economies (FSE) has been given considerable attention in the recent empirical literature. Table 1 provides a brief overview of these studies, which share several common features. First, all of them are based on the frontier methodology according to which each bank’s performance is benchmarked against a frontier reflecting the characteristics of the best-performing banks in the sample.
Footnote 1 Most of the studies employ stochastic frontier model (SFM), a parametric method that is less sensitive to the measurement errors in the sample compared to the alternative non-parametric method, viz., the data envelopment analysis (DEA). Next, efficiency analysis is conducted for two important measures of bank performance: costs and profits. In both cases, the variables determining technology of banks include quantities of outputs (such as loans, investments, other earning assets) and input prices (such as cost of capital, labor, financial funds).
Footnote 2 Finally, all studies assume that banks share a common production technology. In other words, production capacity of all banks is described by an identical production possibility frontier. The aim of this paper is to relax the latter restrictive assumption by allowing for multiple technology regimes, conditional on differences in economic environments in which banks operate. The main criticism of the homogenous technological regime assumption adopted by all studies reviewed in Table 1 is the potential bias in the frontier estimates and, thus, the obtained efficiency scores (Orea and Kumbhakar 2004). Specifically, if the true technology is heterogenous, then the omitted technological differences might be inappropriately labeled as inefficiency in single-frontier estimations. Consequently, the impact of inefficiency determinants might be misunderstood. Another drawback of the homogenous technological regime assumption is that it imposes restrictions on certain important characteristics of banking technology, such as technical progress and scale economies. There are several approaches that can accommodate technological differences. One approach is to include country-specific environmental variables that are likely to influence technologies of banks, such as the level of economic development and institutional background, as additional explanatory variables in the frontier (Berger 2007). In fact, most of the cross-country studies reviewed in Table 1 augment the frontier by country-specific variables (Fries and Taci 2005; Bonin et al. 2005; Yildirim and Philippatos 2007; Poghosyan and Borovicka 2007; Green et al. 2007). The main disadvantage of this approach is that the introduction of the environmental variables only affects the intercept of the frontier specification, leaving the slope parameters unaffected (Bos and Schmiedel 2007). Thus, although more flexibility in intercepts may partially alleviate the bias in inefficiency estimates (Valverde et al. 2007), the constancy of the slope parameters will still impose restrictions on technical progress and scale economies of banks. Another drawback of this approach is that technological differences are assumed to be country-specific, which rules out the possibility that banks located within the same country may employ different business models (Koetter and Poghosyan 2009). An alternative approach to alleviate the impact of technological differences is a priori sample separation. The sample separation can be based, for instance, on the organizational structure of banks (Mester 1993; Altunbas et al. 2001), or their geographical location (Mester 1996; Bos and Schmiedel 2007). The main disadvantage of this approach is that a priori restriction of sample separation is to some extent arbitrary. For instance, Koetter and Poghosyan (2009) show that even banks having similar organizational structure can operate under different technological regimes. In this study, we account for differences in technological regimes using a latent class stochastic frontier model (LCSFM), which addresses the disadvantages associated with the aforementioned alternative approaches (Orea and Kumbhakar 2004; Greene 2005).
Footnote 3 Unlike the first approach, the impact of the environmental factors is not only reflected in the magnitude of the intercepts, but also affects the slope coefficients. Here, the environmental variables enter as latent class determinants rather than as a part of the frontier and thus influence both estimates of the technological regime of banks and their cost efficiency simultaneously. Unlike the second approach, the latent class method does not require a priori grouping of banks. Instead, it utilizes all information available in the sample and identifies separate technological regimes based on the maximum likelihood principle. Our results support the conclusion reached by Orea and Kumbhakar (2004) that single-frontier methods result in upward-biased estimates of bank efficiency, since in these models technological differences can be mistakenly attributed to inefficiency. We find that banks in FSE operate under three distinct technological regimes. These technological regimes are shaped by differences across FSE in terms of progress in economic reforms, economic uncertainty, capital regulation, and market structure in the banking sector. We find that progress in economic reforms and low level of risk contribute to bank performance in FSE. In addition, bank efficiency improves in less concentrated banking industries, supporting the structure-conduct-performance hypothesis. Technology differences matter also for the relationship between foreign ownership and bank performance widely analyzed in previous work. We find that positive impact of foreign ownership on bank efficiency is present only in less developed FSE with higher degree of risk, while this relationship does not hold for more advanced and stable FSE. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that adoption of EU standards by the new EU member FSE has contributed to the improved bank performance in these countries. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the LCSFM and estimation details. A data description is provided in Sect. 3, while the estimation results are discussed in Sect. 4. The last section concludes.",12

In the first paper following this introduction, Evenson and Fuglie take on the rather ambitious task of measuring and comparing agricultural TFP growth for the entire world, as well as individual countries and regions, between 1961 and 2006.Footnote 2 They employ a Solow-type growth accounting framework to compare long-run TFP growth (but not TFP levels) across countries. Further, they develop indexes of “technology capital” and examine whether differences in such capital help explain differences in productivity performance among countries. Their results indicate that while agricultural TFP growth in OECD countries has remained constant or slightly declined, TFP growth in developing and transition economies accelerated in the 1990s. Among developing countries, they find a strong, positive relationship between “technology capital” (research and education capacities, primarily) and long-run agricultural TFP growth. The other four papers of this volume focus on the productivity growth experience of particular countries or regions. Jin, Ma, Huang, Hu and Rozelle use a stochastic production frontier approach to measure TFP growth for each of 23 commodities in Chinese agriculture, and decompose TFP growth into the shares due to technical change and efficiency improvement. Their results give evidence of broad-based and rapid productivity growth in Chinese agriculture, especially since 1990, and attribute most of this growth to technical change. They also find evidence of considerable disequilibrium in the Chinese agricultural sector and rising technical inefficiency during this period of rapid structural change in the economy since 1990. Nin Pratt, Yu and Fan use a non-parametric Malmquist index to compare agricultural TFP growth between India and China. Their results show that both countries accelerated agricultural TFP growth following policy and institutional reforms. However, China’s agricultural TFP growth acceleration was much more pronounced, which the authors attribute to more fundamental institutional changes as well as greater structural transformation of the Chinese economy. In his study of Indonesia, Fuglie estimates a Tornqvist-Thiel TFP index for the country’s agriculture. He also finds evidence of an acceleration of agricultural TFP growth since the mid-1990s. In this case, a new source of productivity growth appears to be arising from greater diversification into high-valued and export commodities and declining reliance on growth from traditional food staples. Finally, in their broad study of productivity change in the 23 transition economies of the former Soviet Socialist Republics and Eastern Europe, Swinnen and Vranken analyze four sets of productivity indicators drawing upon both aggregate and micro-level data. Their results show how productivity growth varies between countries at various stages of the transition process, with all countries showing a decline in productivity at the beginning of the transition period and productivity recovery later on. But individual country experiences vary widely, and appear to be linked to both initial conditions and the pace of economic and institutional reforms.",8

Fried,Robert Simmons,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many of the papers in this Special Issue utilize a production function methodology: inputs are related to outputs. Some of the papers utilize a frontier production function methodology. It is helpful to keep in mind the difference. Frontier production functions fit relationships to the outlying observations in the dataset rather than fit a “line” through the middle of the data. Frontier approaches identify best practice; conventional approaches identify average practice. Both approaches are useful and interesting. The remainder of this introduction examines each paper in turn, identifying its novel contribution. The point is not to provide a summary. The specific findings are left to the reader to enjoy. Watch out for the frontier production function methodology, particularly the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) embedded in a stochastic framework. DEA efficiency scores are bootstrapped and the second stage explanatory regression is based upon a bootstrapped truncated regression. The approach is financial. Outputs are revenue components; inputs are cost components and assets. The financial technical efficiency of teams in the Spanish League is particularly important since football has become more highly integrated throughout Europe (and the world). Teams no longer operate in insular markets that are sheltered from outside competition. Again, note the frontier production function methodology; a stochastic frontier model with time varying technical efficiency is applied to a unique panel data set. The results are decomposed to reveal that the efficiency of individual teams tends to vary over time, but the average efficiency of the league tends to be stable. The German League relegates the worst performing teams each year to the second tier of the league hierarchy. Interestingly, relegated teams tend to have poor technical efficiency scores. Moreover, teams with poor efficiency scores tend to replace the head coach. On both counts, the model passes a realism-based sniff test. The order in which players are drafted in the NBA does not predict their performance; this is not because of the lack of data, but because the wrong data is used. This finding is related to evidence that NBA teams over emphasize scoring in their evaluation of player performance. The “market” gets it wrong. Why? How long will this persist? The reverse order draft is based upon the connection between draft order and professional performance. Note some novel contributions: Professional performance is typically evaluated on an aggregate basis for the season according to measures such as net points, wins, quarterback score or quarterback rating. Aggregate measures of performance are related to draft order. However, aggregate measures do not control for the number of plays that the quarterback runs. Per play measures of performance are not related to draft order. Earlier draft picks play more than later draft picks; they do not necessarily play better. Notice the use of a stochastic frontier approach to identify managerial inefficiency and to relate this to factors that characterize a small-ball strategy. The production function specifies the transformation of player talent into wins; the inefficiency term captures the contribution of the manager. The inefficiency term is specified as a function of the characteristics of a small-ball strategy. The signs and significance of the coefficients on the characteristics of small-ball constitute the test of the effectiveness of a small-ball strategy. Research on salaries and productivity in major league baseball typically rely upon a pooled sample that includes players of all abilities, ranging from super stars to journeymen. This paper investigates possible differences in the relationship between productivity and salaries for players according to player ability. Separate regressions are run for each talent quintile. Since the time profile of the relationship between pay and performance is of particular interest, the salary regression is a function of experience rather than typical performance measures. The method is order-m FDH. This is a non-parametric frontier method that introduces a stochastic element to mitigate the effect of outliers. The production function relates performance on the PGA tour to conventional measures of golfing ability. The inefficiency term is interpreted to be a quantitative measure of the ability to perform under pressure. As a golfer ages, physical ability and mental fortitude eventually decline. The impact of age on the ability to perform under pressure is identified, controlling for physical golfing ability. Welcome to the JPA Special Issue on Sports. Have fun.",2

On non-parametrically measuring scale economies in non-convex technologies,June 2011,Kristof De Witte,Rui C. Marques,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Both academics and practitioners are interested in the optimal scale of operations. From the viewpoint of scholars, the scale of operations touches the debate on returns to scale (RTS) of the production frontier. RTS denotes the relation between a proportional change in inputs and the corresponding (proportional) change in outputs. Especially the introduction of different scale assumptions in non-convex frontier models (e.g. the Free Disposal Hull model, Deprins et al. 1984) recently attracted a significant amount of attention (e.g. Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut 1999; Podinovski 2004a, c; Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi 2007). On the other hand, practitioners are interested in insights on the optimal scale of operations as (1) they guide the individual utilities in their strategic decisions, (2) give direction to the government’s incentives, or (3) inspire merger commissions and regulators. This paper explores the concepts of RTS in non-convex models and provides a framework to employ them in real world applications where uncertainty and heterogeneity is accounted for in the data by using the robust and conditional efficiency estimates of, respectively, Cazals et al. (2002) and Daraio and Simar (2005, 2007). The non-parametric literature has extensively discussed the use and existence of scale economies in convex frontier models as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) (e.g. Banker et al. 2004 and reference therein). However, the convexity assumption where DEA works with is sometimes difficult to argue in real world applications as it implies additivity and divisibility (see Cherchye et al. 2000a, b; Briec et al. 2004 and references therein). If in DEA the convexity assumption is dropped, one obtains the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) model (Deprins et al. 1984). Unfortunately, in the traditional FDH models scale economies are neglected as only variable returns to scale (VRS) are assumed. Only recently, Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999) integrated RTS assumptions in this non-convex model without invoking convexity (and thus without assuming convex combinations of utilities). Besides the opportunity to test the direction of the RTS, the inclusion of the relaxed convexity assumptions allows for an increased discrimination among the evaluated entities (Destefanis and Storti 2002). Indeed, in the traditional FDH formulation many observations are ‘efficient by default’ as frequently only few reference partners exist in a particular section of the production function. The RTS model accounts for this by enlarging the reference set to proportional replicas of observed variables (i.e. by imposing additional structure). After having described the traditional non-convex FDH model, we outline how to include RTS assumptions in FDH. This model, as developed by Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999), is further described in Briec et al. (2004) and linearized to mixed integer linear programming models by Podinovski (2004a, c). Recently, less computationally intensive alternatives for the mixed integer linear programming models were proposed by Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007). This article contributes to this literature by extending the model in order to avoid two intricate issues in deterministic frontier models. On the one hand, we allow for noise in the data (arising from, e.g. outliers, a-typical observations and measurement errors) by considering the robust efficiency estimates of Cazals et al. (2002). On the other hand, we include heterogeneity in the sample by employing the conditional efficiency estimates of Daraio and Simar (2005, 2007). In extending the non-convex RTS models, we develop three additional contributions. Firstly, we introduce a fully non-parametric and continuous presentation of the Most Productive Scale Size (MPSS) concept (Banker 1984). In particular, we suggest a graphical presentation of the minimal cost per unit of production in order to derive the optimal scale size for a sector as a whole. As such, this representation creates a convenient tool for practitioners. Secondly, we provide a comprehensive and easy implementable framework to measure the existence and extent of scale economies. In this framework, which consists of three steps, we first interpret the conditional efficiency measures of Daraio and Simar (2005, 2007) to detect the existence of scale economies. This first step is also useful to detect scope economies. The latter are present if the simultaneous production of goods is less costly than the separate production. As scope economies are interrelated with the scale of operations (indeed, as argued by Baumol et al. (1988) a larger scope of operations induces a larger scale of the company as well), we disentangle the two effects in order to obtain the ‘pure’ scale economies. When examining RTS, the literature frequently ignores this first step and simply assumes the existence of RTS. We argue that one should first test for the presence of RTS before analyzing its direction. A second step derives the RTS for every individual observation. Following Podinovski (2004b), we distinguish local and global economies of scale such that the traditional constant, increasing and decreasing RTS are contrasted to sub-constant RTS (SCRS) (which indicates that an observation could obtain its MPSS by both scaling-up or scaling-down its operations).
Footnote 1 The third step of the framework examines the optimal scale of operations of the sector. The continuous version of the MPSS delivers rapid policy insights as it presents a visual representation of the minimal cost level. A final contribution of the paper lies in its empirical application which considers the Portuguese drinking water utilities. Inspired by the current debate in the Portuguese water sector, in which both the regulator and the water utilities are doubting on the optimal scale of operations, we examine the economies of scale in the sector. In addition, this application suits the branch of the literature which detects economies of scale in drinking water utilities. For example Sabbioni (2007) for Brazil using a sample of 1,163 water utilities for the period 2000–2004 found the regional companies ere more scale efficient than local ones. In Canada, Renzetti (1999) reports the occurrence of substantial economies of scale for a sample of 77 utilities in Ontario for the period 1997–2000. For England and Wales, Ashton (2000) and Cubbin and Tzanifdakis (1998) using a translog cost function and DEA conclude by the existence of significant economies of scale. In Italy, Antonioli and Filippini 2001 took the same conclusions applying a Cobb-Douglas function for a sample of 32 water utilities between 1991 and 1995. Garcia and Thomas (2001) for France using translog specification for the variable cost function found short-run scale economies and for the long-run the absence of economies of scale. In the USA, Garcia et al. (2004) for the 171 water utilities of the State of Wisconsin found scale economies for the vertically integrated small utilities. They use as well a translogatithic specification form. Frequently, scale economies are found for small utilities (where the optimal scale obviously depends on the characteristic of a country) while diseconomies of scale are detected for larger companies. In Brazil, Ohira and Shirota (2005), employing a Cobb-Douglas for 179 water utilities, observe diseconomies of scale. Saal and Parker (2005), for England and Wales, using an input distance function (total cost) show that no scale economies exist for the average sized firm. Mizutani and Urakami (2001) in Japan for the year 1994 for Japan using different parametric functional form specification found diseconomies of scale at the sample mean. The optimal size corresponds to an water utility which supply 261 millions m3 per year, has 1,221 km of mains length and serves 766.000 inhabitants. The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the robust and conditional FDH model. Section 3 introduces the scaling of operations in non-convex technologies. Section 4 provides a three step framework to analyze the existence and extent of scale economies. In Sect. 5, we show by an empirical application the merits of our framework. Finally, we conclude.",30

Complementarity is understood in this context to exist if the implementation of one practice increases the marginal or incremental return to other practices. Joint implementation of several practices may result in economies of scope (Baumol et al. 1988). The implementation of one practice might also decrease the marginal or incremental return to other practices. This is the case of substitutability (or subadditivity). Examples of studies of complementarity are the relationships between human resource practices and firm strategy (Ichniowski et al. 1997), firms’ internal R&D and external technology sourcing (Arora and Gambardella 1990), process and product innovation (Miravete and Pernias 2004), labor skill and innovation strategies (Leiponen 2005), different government innovation policies (Mohnen and Röller 2005), information technology, workplace reorganization, and new product and service innovations (Black and Lynch 2001; Bresnahan et al. 2002; Caroli and Van Reenen 2001), adoption of different information technologies in emergency health care (Athey and Stern 2002), different types of labor in the determination of trade patterns (Grossman and Maggi 2000) and use of external knowledge across different stages of new product development (Love and Roper 2009). There are two econometric approaches used to test for complementarity: the “adoption” or “correlation” approach and the “production function” approach (e.g. Athey and Stern 1998). The former has been popular among empirical researchers due to its simplicity (Arora 1996). The adoption approach tests conditional correlations based on the residuals of reduced form regressions of the practices of interest on all exogenous variables. However, although this test can serve as supportive evidence of complementarity, it cannot serve as a definitive test. Estimated correlations between residuals may be the result of common omitted exogenous variables or measurement errors. Even in the case of well-measured correlation between practices, decision makers may not have been sufficiently well informed such that they chose efficiency or output enhancing combinations of practices. The “production function” approach, in which organizational performance is related to combinations of organizational practices, does not have these drawbacks and can serve as a direct test for complementarity or substitutability.Footnote 1 However, no easily executable testing procedure has been available to test for complementarity or substitutability with more than two practices.Footnote 2 Studies adopting the production function approach have limited analysis to the estimation of pair-wise interaction effects, either including all pair-wise terms (e.g. Caroli and Van Reenen 2001), or estimating only the pair-wise interaction of interest (e.g. Bresnahan et al. 2002). This approach ignores the impact of additional cross-terms (e.g. a triple term in case of three practices), it examines only a partial expression for the cross derivative and is prone to an omitted variable bias that affects all coefficients. As noted by Athey and Stern (1998), a proper complementarity or substitutability test requires a testing framework that considers the complete set of organizational practices. In this paper we develop such a test based on a multiple-inequality restrictions framework corresponding to a definition of strict supermodularity or submodularity (Milgrom and Roberts 1990). We provide Monte Carlo results comparing the power of this test with the performance of the two pair-wise tests.",45

The mapping summarizes a program that identifies the best practice technologies or benchmarks for the firm. The performance of a firm will be measured by its output/input ratio or productivity—a concept that I will connect explicitly to the aforementioned efficiency function. Aggregate performance may rise more than firm performance scores suggest, if resources are better allocated between firms. The excess is the industrial organization effect. Debreu (1951) recognized imperfections in economic organization as a source of aggregate inefficiency and Diewert (1983) analyzed them for open economies, focussing on price distortions. I operationalize these ideas in an activity analytic framework, but without using external price information (such as the world prices an open economy faces), as Nesterenko and Zelenyuk (2007) do. Another novelty is that my theory of benchmarking extends my interrelationship of two value-based performance measures—Diewert’s (1981) price index measurement and Solow’s (1957) residual analysis—from the back-of-the-envelope calculation for production functions (ten Raa 2005) to the activity framework. There is more to the performance of a composite such as an industry than micro or firm performance and composition effects. Blackorby and Russell (1999) and Briec et al. (2003) have shown that things do not add up except under restrictive conditions. Bartelsman and Doms’ (2000, p. 571) understanding that ""Aggregated productivity can be computed as the share-weighted average of individual productivity"" is not exactly right. Indeed, Briec et al. (2003, Proposition 5) and Färe and Grosskopf (2004, p. 108) noticed a bias, ten Raa (2005) related it to the departure of the industrial efficiency condition that marginal productivities are equalized, and Balk (2009) shows that in a growth accounting setting with independent disaggregated price and quantity information differential price changes add a term to aggregate productivity change. I now proceed to interpret the bias as an industrial organization inefficiency measure. A main contribution of this paper is the interrelation of productivity analysis and the theory of industrial organization. A proposition proves that an industrial organization is efficient (in the sense of productivity analysis) if and only if it is supportable in Sharkey and Telser’s (1978) sense of being entry-proof. The closest framework is that of Li and Ng (1995), who distinguish technical efficiency, allocatively efficiency and reallocative efficiency; the latter corresponds to my measure of industrial organization efficiency. They measure all efficiencies using the shadow prices of the efficiency program of the industry as a whole, while I employ the individual firm shadow prices for the micro efficiencies and show that departures between the two signal organizational inefficiency.",23

With only cross-sectional data, the stochastic frontier model can provide estimates of the parameters of a production, cost, or profit frontier, along with estimates of firm-specific efficiency scores. With the availability of panel data the model could be extended to better exploit the nature of the data. Three distinct directions could be identified in this stream of literature. The first possibility is to use linear panel data techniques to relax the distributional assumptions made by the original stochastic frontier model. Schmidt and Sickles (1984), for example, estimate a production frontier assuming fixed- or random-effects. After the estimation, the firm-specific constants are used to calculate efficiency scores. The firm with the largest intercept is termed the most efficient and it is used for benchmarking. This method assumes that there is no unobserved heterogeneity in the sample and, additionally, that the firm-specific efficiency scores are constant over time. Cornwell et al. (1990) relax the assumption of time-invariant efficiency scores by specifying a quadratic firm-specific function of time to capture the inefficiency effects. Recently, Ahn et al. (2007) propose a technique that combines regression and factor analysis to overcome the difficulties introduced in the previous model by the very large number of parameters to be estimated.Footnote 1
 The second approach taken in the stochastic frontier literature when panel data are available is to distinguish unobserved heterogeneity
Footnote 2 in the sample from inefficiency. Kumbhakar (1991) specifies a random-effects model with time effects to separate inefficiency from factors that are outside the control of the firm. Greene (2005a, b) proposes fixed- and random-effects models, among others, for dealing with the issue of unobserved heterogeneity. Both authors propose estimation by maximum likelihood. In such a setting, however, and especially in short panels, the incidental parameters problem is likely to bias the estimates when fixed-effects are assumed. Furthermore, some questions of identification are raised. Because both firm effects and inefficiency are assumed to affect only the intercept in a stochastic model, it is not clear how to proceed in distinguishing the two. Econometric identification is achieved by exploiting the skewness of the composite error term. Under any conventional assumption around the distribution of the inefficiency component of the error term, any time invariant part of inefficiency at the firm level will be grouped together with unobserved heterogeneity, as skewness will now be defined relative to the firm effect. The economic validity of this separation naturally depends on the validity of the argument that time-invariant firm effects represent heterogeneity rather than inefficiency (Greene 2005a). The third direction exploits the panel nature of the data to allow for the efficiency scores to vary over time, yet still maintaining some distributional assumptions. Kumbhakar (1990) and Battese and Coelli (1992) specify deterministic functions of time for the evolution of the efficiency scores. In both specifications these functions are common to all firms, but, are scaled by firm-specific constants. These models are appropriate for describing the time path of efficiency scores for an industry on average. However, by restricting the time paths to have the same structure across firms, they cannot model firm-level dynamic behavior. If, for example, firms operate with a long-run objective in mind and, for some reason, they find themselves out of their long-run equilibrium, then the evolution of their efficiency scores would be different, depending on where the firm currently is with respect to its equilibrium. A stochastic frontier model that is truly dynamic in nature should capture changes in efficiency scores that occur as firms adjust to their long-run equilibrium. Ahn et al. (2000) and Tsionas (2006) specify autoregressive structures in the evolution of the firm-specific scores as a way of expressing the dynamic process of adjustment. These autoregressive inefficiency models recognize the fact that firms which are highly inefficient today have high probability of remaining inefficient in the future. Furthermore, depending on a given firm’s stage of adjustment, the path toward the long-run equilibrium could be different. In this paper we propose the estimation of a production stochastic frontier model with autocorrelated inefficiency and unobserved heterogeneity. The primary objective is the separation of unobserved heterogeneity from inefficiency in a dynamic context. In the next section the dynamic frontier model is justified from an economic point of view. Furthermore, it is argued that production frontiers are appropriate for measuring efficiency only in the short run. Firms that operate in a dynamic environment and have a long-run objective may be inefficient in the short run simply because this is the optimal strategy to achieve the long-run objective. Section 3 suggests that the issue of unobserved heterogeneity becomes particularly important when the objective is the identification of the level of inefficiency that is likely to persist in the long run. Random- and correlated random-effects specifications are proposed and separation of heterogeneity from inefficiency is achieved by exploiting the skewness of the composite error term, along with the time dependence of observed output. Next, the estimation approach is described and the estimator is evaluated using artificial data. An application of the model to a panel of US electric utilities is presented in Section 5. Section 6 provides some concluding comments.",30

This field is currently dominated by two approaches: the nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA: Farrell 1957; Charnes et al. 1978) and the parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA: Aigner et al. 1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck 1977). The main appeal of DEA lies in its axiomatic, nonparametric treatment of the frontier, which does not assume a particular functional form but relies on the general regularity properties such as free disposability, convexity, and assumptions concerning the returns to scale. However, the conventional DEA attributes all deviations from the frontier to inefficiency, and ignores any stochastic noise in the data. The key advantage of SFA is its stochastic treatment of these deviations, which are decomposed into a non-negative inefficiency term and a random disturbance term that accounts for measurement errors and other random noise. However, SFA builds on the parametric regression techniques, which require an ex ante specification of the functional form. Since the economic theory rarely justifies a particular functional form, the flexible functional forms, such as the translog or generalized McFadden are frequently used. In contrast to DEA, the flexible functional forms often violate the monotonicity, concavity/convexity and homogeneity conditions. Further, imposing these conditions can sacrifice the flexibility (see e.g., Sauer 2006). In summary, it is generally accepted that the virtues of DEA lie in its general, nonparametric treatment of the frontier, while the virtues of SFA lie in its stochastic, probabilistic treatment of inefficiency and noise. Bridging the gap between SFA and DEA has been recognized as one of the most important research objectives in this field, and contributions to this end have accumulated since the early 1990s. The emerging literature on semi/nonparametric stochastic frontier estimation has thus far mainly departed from the SFA side, replacing the parametric frontier function by a nonparametric specification that can be estimated by kernel regression or local maximum likelihood (ML) techniques. Fan et al. (1996) and Kneip and Simar (1996) were among the first to apply kernel regression to frontier estimation in the cross-sectional and panel data contexts, respectively. Fan et al. (1996) proposed a two-step method where the shape of the frontier is first estimated by kernel regression, and the conditional expected inefficiency is subsequently estimated based on the residuals, imposing the same distributional assumptions as in standard SFA. Kneip and Simar (1996) similarly use kernel regression for estimating the frontier, but they make use of panel data to avoid the distributional assumptions. Other semi/nonparametric panel data approaches include Park et al. (1998, 2003, 2006) and Henderson and Simar (2005), among others. Recently, Kumbhakar et al. (2007) proposed a more flexible SFA method based on local polynomial ML estimation. While the model is parametrized in a similar way to the standard SFA models, all model parameters are approximated by local polynomials. Simar and Zelenyuk (2008) have further extended the local polynomial ML method to multi-output technologies, building upon results by Hall and Simar (2002) and Simar (2007). Interestingly, Simar and Zelenyuk (2008) also apply DEA to the fitted values of the Kumbhakar et al. (2007) method in order to impose monotonicity and concavity. Departing from the DEA side, Banker and Maindiratta (1992) were the first to consider ML estimation of the stochastic frontier model subject to the global free disposability and convexity axioms adopted from the DEA literature. While their theoretical model combines the essential features of the classic DEA and SFA models, solving the resulting ML problem has proved extremely difficult, if not impossible in practical applications. We are not aware of any reported empirical applications of the Banker and Maindiratta’s constrained ML method. While the earlier semi/nonparametric developments come a long way in bridging the gap between DEA and SFA approaches, further elaboration of the interface between these two paradigms is clearly desirable. Since conventional DEA literature emphasizes the fundamental philosophical difference between DEA and the regression techniques (e.g., Cooper et al. 2004), the intimate links between DEA and regression analysis may not have attracted sufficient attention. In this respect, the recent studies Kuosmanen (2008) and Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) have shown that DEA can be understood as a constrained special case of nonparametric least squares subject to shape constraints. More specifically, Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) prove formally that the classic output-oriented DEA estimator can be computed in the single-output case by solving the convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) problem (Hildreth 1954; Hanson and Pledger 1976; Groeneboom et al. 2001a,b; Kuosmanen 2008) subject to monotonicity and concavity constraints that characterize the frontier, and a sign constraint on the regression residuals. Thus, DEA can be naturally viewed as a nonparametric counterpart to the parametric programming approach of Aigner and Chu (1968). Building on this analogue, Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) propose a nonparametric counterpart to the classic COLS method (Greene 1980), which has generally a higher discriminatory power than the conventional DEA in the deterministic setting. However, the deterministic frontier shifting method of Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) is more sensitive to stochastic noise than the conventional DEA. Departing from Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010), this paper introduces a stochastic noise term explicitly into the theoretical model to be estimated, and takes it into account in the estimation. In the spirit of Banker and Maindiratta (1992), we examine an encompassing semiparametric frontier model that includes the classic SFA and DEA models as its constrained special cases. More specifically, we assume that the observed data deviates from a nonparametric, DEA-style piecewise linear frontier production function due to a stochastic SFA-style composite error term, consisting of homoskedastic noise and inefficiency components. To estimate this theoretical model, we develop a new two-stage method, referred to as stochastic non-smooth envelopment of data (StoNED).Footnote 1 In line with Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010), we first estimate the shape of the frontier by applying the CNLS regression, which does not assume a priori any particular functional form for the regression function. CNLS identifies the function that best fits the data from the family of continuous, monotonic increasing, concave functions that can be non-differentiable. In the second stage, we estimate the variance parameters of the stochastic inefficiency and noise terms based on the skewness of the CNLS residuals. The noise term is assumed to be symmetric, so the skewness of the regression residuals is attributed to the inefficiency term. Given the parametric distributional assumptions of the inefficiency and the noise terms, we can estimate the variance parameters by using the method of moments (Aigner et al. 1977) or pseudolikelihood (Fan et al. 1996) techniques. The conditional expected value of the inefficiency term can obtained by using the results of Jondrow et al. (1982). The proposed StoNED method differs from the parametric and semi/nonparametric SFA treatments in that we do not make any assumptions about the functional form or its smoothness, but build upon the global shape constraints (monotonicity, concavity). These shape constraints are equivalent to the free disposability and convexity axioms of DEA. Compared to DEA, the StoNED method differs in its probabilistic treatment of inefficiency and noise. Whereas the DEA frontier is typically spanned by a small number of influential observations, which makes it sensitive to outliers and noise, the StoNED method uses information contained in the entire sample of observations for estimating the frontier, and infers the expected value of inefficiency in a probabilistic fashion. While this paper focuses on the cross-sectional model, we will also briefly suggest how the approach could be extended to the panel data setting. In that case, the time-invariant inefficiency components can be estimated in a fully nonparametric fashion by resorting the standard fixed effects treatment analogous to Schmidt and Sickles (1984). In the cross-sectional setting, imposing some distributional assumptions seems necessary, otherwise inefficiency cannot be distinguished from noise. However, the parametric distributional assumptions should not be taken as the main limitation. While the absolute levels of our frontier and the inefficiency estimates critically depend on the distributional assumptions, the shape of the estimated frontier and the relative rankings of the evaluated units are not affected by these assumptions. In contrast, the classic homoskedastic inefficiency term must be recognized as a more critical assumption. Indeed, even the shape of the frontier and the efficiency rankings tend to be biased if the homoskedasticity assumption is violated (see Sect. 4.5 for a more detailed discussion of this point). Dealing with heteroskedastic inefficiency is left as an interesting and important issue to be addressed in the future research.Footnote 2
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the semiparametric model of frontier production function that encompasses the classic DEA and SFA models as its special cases. Section 3 introduces the two-stage estimation strategy of the StoNED method: Sect. 3.2 elaborates the first stage consisting of nonparametric estimation of the production function by employing CNLS regression. Based on the CNLS residuals, we estimate the inefficiency and noise terms by means of method of moments and pseudolikelihood techniques, as described in Sect. 3.3. Section 4 discusses some useful extensions to the proposed approach. Section 5 examines how the proposed techniques perform in a controlled environment of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, Sect. 6 makes concluding remarks. An illustrative example is presented in the “Appendix”.

Approaches to higher education institutions (HEIs) have been changing and, apart from recognizing their obvious role in human capital and knowledge creation, critical analysis concerning their productivity and efficiency has started to gain importance. In particular, due to changing demographic trends and competition for students, as well as a growing squeeze on public entities by financial constraints, public HEIs are under constant pressure to improve their performance. On top of this, competition between universities has been growing steadily, and European HEIs are still struggling to catch up with American institutions. An examination of the existing literature leads us to conclude that there are several gaps in analyses of higher education productivity that need to be filled. First, major attention has thus far been focused on the analysis of productivity performance, in so far as this concerns evaluating the productivity levels of universities (among others: Glass et al. 1995; Johnes 2006a, b; Bonaccorsi et al. 2007). However, such efficiency scores, apart from providing a tool for comparing productivity between units (and, hence, serving as yet another university ranking system), say nothing about changes in productivity across time (and whether universities manage to improve their performance, stagnate or regress). Second, due to problems commonly associated with gathering comparable data for HEIs from multiple countries, such exercises (assessments of productivity changes over time) have usually been conducted with units from only one country (or, exceptionally, as in Agasisti and Johnes 2009 or Agasisti and Pérez-Esparrells 2010, two countries). In fact, Agasisti and Pérez-Esparrells (2010) state: ‘Future research can extend this study. For instance, a wider comparison among universities from different European countries could be useful for policy purposes’ (p.102). From the policy perspective, a comparative cross-European analysis of HEI productivity is of major importance, especially in the light of the integration of European higher education systems under the Bologna process. Finally, certain higher education studies assessing productivity changes over time (Flegg et al. 2004; Johnes 2008; Worthington and Lee 2008; Agasisti and Johnes 2009; Agasisti and Pérez-Esparrells 2010) have adopted techniques based on Malmquist indices that have not been statistically verified. In other words, these authors simply state that productivity (efficiency, technology—if the indices are decomposed) in selected HEIs has increased or decreased, but no formal tool has been applied to check whether the estimates are sensitive to random variations in the data. Traditional Malmquist methodology, based on estimations of distance measures made through data envelopment analysis (DEA), a non-stochastic procedure, does not provide any insight into the statistical significance of its results. There are, however, tools based on resampling (bootstrap) methods that allow us to correct this weakness. Hence, the considerable limits of the existing literature stem from the facts that (i) little is known about productivity changes across universities from several countries analyzed within a common methodological framework, and (ii) methodological issues concerning the significance of the results obtained with Malmquist indices have not been appropriately addressed. A very particular feature of our dataset is its panel dimension, which allows us to go beyond studies that only compare efficiency scores across units of higher education (usually from just one country). We have managed to gather comparable statistics concerning the inputs and outputs of 266 public HEIs from seven European countries (namely: Austria, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland) over the time period 2001–2005. Moreover, the bootstrap estimation procedure adopted (Simar and Wilson 1999) corrects the basic and possibly biased information given by Malmquist indices of productivity, providing us with confidence intervals for these indices and their components. As a result, we have a tool to verify whether changes in the productivity of European HEIs, as indicated by Malmquist indices, are significant in a statistical sense (i.e. whether the result indicates a real change in the productivity of a given HEI or is just an outcome of sampling noise). Thus, by focusing on the two limits described above and using an original and vast set of microdata on HEIs from several European countries in conjunction with a consistent bootstrap methodology, this study presents an important extension of the existing literature. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we devote Sect. 2 to a presentation of the methodology applied in our analysis (in particular, describing ways of assessing the statistical significance of Malmquist indices) and a concise description of the studies most closely-related to our research. In Sect. 3, we first present our data and then show the statistically significant results of a cross-European assessment of productivity, efficiency and technology changes in 266 HEIs. Conclusions follow.",47

Additionally, several scholars explored different benefits of the well-known quality standard ISO 9000 (Briscoe et al. 2005; Corbett et al. 2005; Pekovic and Galia 2009) and the related ISO 14000 standard on environmental management (Tien et al. 2005; Zutshi and Sohal 2004). However, while the economic benefit of standards seems to be widely acknowledged within scientific literature, the benefit of taking part in standardization remains a rather unexplored mystery to date. All the above mentioned studies take the output of the standardization process into account, i.e., the standard (stock). With regard to the standardization process itself, the literature, on the one hand, theoretically addresses possible benefits of the firm’s engagement in standardization (Antonelli 1994). On the other hand, motives or driving factors that might foster the firm’s propensity to engage in standardization are explored (Blind 2006b; Blind and Mangelsdorf 2016). Consequently, the present paper aims at filling this research gap by theoretically and empirically investigating the impact of participation within standardization on firm performance. Basically, two different types of standardization exist: de jure and de facto standardization. In the latter case, the standard arises from a standardization struggle (and sometimes from a standard war) between different solutions of different firms or coalitions (Chiesa and Toletti 2003). This paper focuses on de jure standardization that is defined by the existence of independent organizations [such as the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)] and partly by the promulgation of standards by legislative bodies as in the case of mandated standards (David and Greenstein 1990). However, the rather loose tag “de jure standardization” actually fits only in case of mandated standards so that we deem appropriate to use the wording “formal standardization”. Formal standardization processes are transparent and open to any company. Accordingly, formal standards are developed in consensus with all interested parties involved as defined within international rules (see, e.g., ISO/IEC Directives). Every organization is invited to join this process, but no organization is obliged to do so. The decision whether to participate in formal standardization or not is exclusively made at organizational level. Thus, organizations that become involved in standardization not only bear the costs for doing so but also derive benefits out of it that apparently exceed the costs. In theory, standard setters not only benefit from the possibility to monitor and shape the development of standards but also access a wide range of knowledge sources in the standards committee. Consequently, the benefits for the organization are manifold and can influence different profit generating parameters. Standard setters may use standards for the promotion of the diffusion of their innovative products or services so that participation within standardization constitutes a means of marketing. They also may gain competitive advantages by accessing the specifications of upcoming standards prior to their publication and, therewith, prior to competitors not involved in standardization. Besides, we also consider standards committees as a meeting point of different stakeholders (competitors, suppliers, customers, etc.) within a specific scope. The participants of these committees gain access to valuable knowledge that is not necessarily codified in the upcoming standard but shared implicitly. Hence, participation within formal standardization also constitutes a means of knowledge sourcing, which might increase an organization’s innovativeness. Chiesa and Toletti (2003) suggest that a single firm quite often is not able to adequately sponsor the adoption of its technology as a standard so that collaborations have to be formed. Consequently, participation within formal standardization is used not only for the diffusion of innovations but also for the generation of knowledge. To sum up, formal standardization might contribute to the performance of its participants in one of the above described manners. Against this background, the paper focuses on firms participating in formal standardization and investigates how this participation contributes to the firm’s performance. Methodologically, firm performance is estimated using Solow residuals of a Cobb-Douglas production function. We consider firm performance to be an appropriate indicator to take all the above mentioned aspects into account simultaneously and holistically. Within our analysis, two different types of standard setting firms are distinguished, namely manufacturers and service providers. The provision of services is more or less individual, which might cause reluctance concerning standardization. Moreover, several service industries are still highly regulated and only some aspects seem to be worth standardizing. Hence, standardization of services is rather complex compared to that of products (Blind 2006a). The analysis of the service providers’ activities within standardization (Wakke et al. 2012) revealed that service providers mainly use standardization for technology-related aspects, while only a minor share of service providers actually set up service standards. As for the technology-related activities of service providers within standardization, a further distinction can be drawn between service providers that use technologies from the manufacturing industries and service providers that develop technologies themselves by means of research and development activities (Droege and Hildebrand 2009; Miozzo and Soete 2001). Thus, the so-called technology-using and technology-developing service industries are additionally distinguished in order to shed as much light as possible on the effects of participation within formal standardization on firm performance. The paper is organized into five sections. The next section briefly reviews the literature on the relation between participation within formal standardization and firm performance, which is the major issue of this analysis to be covered. The third section deals with the methodology, while the fourth section reports the statistics and the results of the empirical analysis. Finally, the fifth section derives implications based on the results.",24

Greene,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Ever since Switzerland’s electrification at the beginning of the 20th century, hydropower has been the country’s main domestic source of electricity. Over time, Swiss hydropower firms have consolidated their position as reliable, cost effective and renewable base and peak load electricity producers. Hydropower also has enabled Switzerland to play an active role on the European electricity market. The pursued business models can roughly be summarized as follows: run-of-river plants produce base load electricity while storage and pump-storage plants use their natural water inflows to help covering electricity demand at peak hours, usually occurring at noon and early evening. All three technology types not only produce for the domestic market, but also are extensively involved in exporting activities to the European grid. A special role is accorded to the pump-storage plants, whose business model exploits the spread between peak and off-peak electricity prices. In addition of using natural water inflows for electricity generation, they pump water into their reservoirs during off-peak hours at favorable prices—often during nighttime—by consuming electricity directly from the high voltage grid. This electricity is partly sourced from the European electricity market, and especially from the French nuclear fleet. At peak load times, the water is turbinated again and the generated electricity is sold at comparatively high prices. This business model was very successful until 2008. Then, the economic crisis, the low price of coal, the low price of CO2 certificates not reflecting the emission’s external costs and the subsidy system for renewable energies such as wind and photovoltaics have led to a significant drop in overall market prices for electricity. In this context, the competitiveness of the coal power plants, which do not have to cover all of their external costs, has increased significantly. In addition, the spread between peak and off-peak electricity prices on the European electricity markets have decreased or at some hours even completely disappeared. In this context, the competitiveness of the coal power plants has increased significantly. Furthermore, since 2009 the Swiss electricity market has been partially liberalized, giving electricity distribution companies and large customers consuming more than 100 MWh per year the possibility to purchase electricity from a producer of their choice in Switzerland or other European countries or to buy electricity directly on the European spot markets. Of course, this reform has increased the level of competition among the Swiss hydropower firms resulting in a pressure to reduce production costs. In January 2015, the decoupling of the Swiss Franc from the Euro has led to an additional reduction in margins, since the electricity traded on a European level is denominated in Euros. For these reasons, a growing share of hydropower plants has started to incur financial losses in recent years. In the current competitive context, it is of immediate importance for them to identify strategies to increase competitiveness by reducing production costs. One possibility to achieve such goal is to improve the level of cost efficiency, which, as discussed in Colombi et al. (2011, 2014), can be split into two parts: a persistent and a transient one. The persistent part captures cost inefficiencies which do not vary with time. These could be inefficiencies due to recurring identical management mistakes, structural problems within the electricity generation process or factor misallocations that are difficult to change over time. On the other hand, the transient component represents cost inefficiencies varying with time, e.g., singular, non-systematic management mistakes. In the short- to medium-run, a firm’s leverage is expected to be mainly on the improvement of the transient part of cost efficiency. Information on the level of cost efficiency is of importance not only for the firms, but also for the Swiss federal government. In fact—because of the distortionsFootnote 1 on the European electricity market—the Swiss parliament decided in 2015, under some circumstances, to financially support hydropower firms in financial distress. However, the political process of specifying the details of such a subsidization system is still ongoing. From an economic policy point of view, it is important to grant such subsidies only to firms operating already with a high degree of efficiency. Hence, knowledge on the level of cost efficiency supports the government in avoiding subsidizing inefficient hydropower firms. Despite the fact that hydropower still is the world’s dominant source of renewable energy, the scientific literature only comprises a few published studies on the productive efficiency of hydropower firms.Footnote 2 Banfi and Filippini (2010) study the cost structure and level of cost efficiency of an unbalanced panel of 43 Swiss hydropower firms observed from 1995 to 2002. Using a translog variable cost function, they employ the true random effects model proposed by Greene (2005a, b), i.e., a stochastic frontier approach. The explanatory variables considered are: total amount of electricity produced, number of plants per firm, price of labor and capital stock. Furthermore, four binary indicators are added to the model controlling for different types of technology.Footnote 3 Their empirical results indicate economies of utilization as well as the presence of cost inefficiency. By also using a variable cost function approach, Barros and Peypoch (2007) examine the cost efficiency of a balanced panel of 25 Portuguese hydropower plants, all of them belonging to the main Portuguese utility, for the years 1994 to 2004.Footnote 4 From the econometric point of view, these authors also use a translog functional form and the true random effects model. Finally, Barros et al. (2013) analyze the level of cost efficiency of a relatively small panel of twelve Chinese hydropower firms for the period 2000 to 2010 using a total cost function in translog functional form. They use a stochastic frontier latent class model to take into account possible differences in the unobserved production technology affecting costs. The estimation results obtained indicate the presence of three distinct groups of firms. Their choice to use a latent class model is an interesting approach for the case where the firms’ production technology is not directly observed. Most of the empirical literature so far has fallen short of a differentiation of the persistent and transient component of productive efficiency. Also the aforementioned studies provide only empirical information on the transient, but not the persistent, part of cost efficiency. With an empirical orientation, this paper’s main goal therefore is to measure the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency for a sample of Swiss hydropower firms by estimating a homothetic translog frontier total cost function. We use a new and representative panel of Swiss hydropower firms. In a firm’s context, the persistent part of productive inefficiency may be due a variety of factors like regulations, investments in inefficient machines or infrastructure or lasting habits of the management to waste inputs. The transient part of inefficiency on the other hand, for example, may stem from temporal behavioral aspects of the management or from a non-optimal use of some machines. Such distinction and measurement of the two components of overall cost efficiency is interesting because it allows the firms to elicit their cost saving potential in the short- as well as the long-run. Furthermore, from a policy point of view, it can be of interest when reforming the electric power sector. The simultaneous measurement of the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency is based on a four component stochastic frontier (SF) model. This model has been introduced by Colombi et al. (2011, 2014) and Kumbhakar et al. (2014). Filippini and Greene (2016) proposed an innovative way of estimating the four component SF model by using maximum simulated likelihood. The contribution of the present paper to the scientific literature is threefold and mainly empirically oriented. Firstly, from an econometric perspective, we provide a stand-alone empirical application of the novel estimation method proposed by Filippini and Greene (2016). Secondly, a rich cost model specification is used, explicitly controlling, e.g., for the technological heterogeneity between run-of-river, storage and pump-storage plants. Thirdly, firm-level information on the two categories of persistent and transient cost inefficiency can help the government to design an effective subsidy policy by granting financial aids only if the firms meet predefined efficiency standards in both categories. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a description and gives and overview of the data used for the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the empirical cost model as well as the chosen functional form, and Section 4 presents the econometric estimation methodologies. Results are summarized in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes and discusses the findings.",20

Triebs,Subal C. Kumbhakar,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists often use productivity estimates as proxies for unobserved management, either to control for omitted variable bias or to measure management at the firm level. For instance, Nickell (1996) estimates the effect of competition on firm productivity and assumes that productivity estimates serve as proxies for management quality, among other things. As management is usually unobserved, the correlation between management and productivity estimatesFootnote 1 is assumed. Using the management data produced by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) we are able to test this assumption empirically. We ask whether two popular productivity estimates, firm fixed effects and inefficiency scores, correlate with observed management practices. Also, we ask whether the assumptions underlying their use, neutrality and monotonicity, are valid. The use of inefficiency estimates as proxies for management goes back at least to Farrell (1957). His model treats the production function as a best-practice frontier and the difference between actual production and best practice as inefficiency. For given inputs and outputs he attributes estimates of technical inefficiency to bad management (p. 261): […] the technical efficiency of a firm or plant indicates the undisputed gain that can be achieved by simply ‘gingering up’ the management […]. Farrell’s model sets management apart from the conventional inputs of capital and labor in the sense that inefficiency indicates the potential for management to increase output for given conventional inputs, implying that management is a technology. Put differently, unlike conventional inputs, management alone cannot produce. Nuthall (2009, p. 413) expresses this as follows: “… the key factor in the management of land, labor and capital is the management ability applied.” On the other hand, Mundlak (1961)’s concern is about omitted variable bias when the management input is unobserved. His model uses firm fixed effects as proxies for management. The model requires panel data and the assumption that management is time-invariant. We empirically test whether the two proxies, inefficiency and fixed effects, correlate with observed management. Both proxies assume that management is a productivity shifter and that better management always increases productivity. Put differently, management affects productivity neutrally and the relation between management and productivity is monotonic. Together these assumptions suggest that management is a technology rather than an input.Footnote 2 To empirically test these two assumptions we apply semiparametric technology models where the influence of management can be non-neutral as well as non-monotonic. A semiparametric model is more general than the parametric linear model Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) use to correlate management with total factor productivity. Their model takes a log-linearized Cobb-Douglas form with management z added in an ad hoc fashion: Iny
i
 = α0 + z′α + Inx′β. They find that management positively correlates with total factor productivity (TFP), α is statistically significant. The parametric linear model helps them validate their survey measure but our investigation of the goodness of productivity as a proxy for management requires a more flexible model. For instance, the use of TFP as a proxy for management requires that TFP increases in management everywhere and not just at the mean. Also, with the parametric linear model, whether management z is a technology depends on the interpretation of the estimated coefficient α. Inconsistent with the management as technology interpretation, management alone can produce positive output. The semiparametric models we apply (Robinson 1988; Li et al. 2002) make the technology explicitly management specific: f z (x), i.e., the production function parameters vary with management. Semiparametric models strike a balance between a standard parametric structure for the conventional inputs and a nonparametric structure for management. The nonparametric part makes the model fully flexible in regard to the effect of management on production and thereby accommodates our theoretical ignorance about how management affects the technology. As the model does not impose the assumptions of neutrality and monotonicity we can test them. Finally, the model allows us to express characteristics of the production function like returns to scale as functions of management. We find that the correlation between fixed effects or inefficiency scores and management is positive but weak: the largest correlation coefficient is 0.35. Also, we find that management explains at most 5% of the variance in the proxies. Firms and policy makers use productivity or inefficiency estimates to assess potential performance improvements through better management. The scope for such improvements might be much lower than suggested by the face values of the proxies. Despite the effect of management on productivity not being strictly neutral, the neutral component gives a relationship between total factor productivity and management that is mostly increasing. Thus, productivity estimates are suitable for ranking firms on management practices but not for quantifying unobserved management practices. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical models that we apply. Section 3 introduces the data. Section 4 gives the results and Section 5 concludes.",21

Krupnik,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Over 84% of the globe’s agricultural land is managed by farmers cultivating less than two hectares, the majority of whom focus primarily on the production of staple cereals such as rice, maize, and wheat (FAO 2014). In South Asia alone, these production systems cater to the food needs of over a billion people (cf. Aravindakshan et al. 2015). Production inefficiencies are a particular concern for resource-poor smallholders in South Asia’s rice-wheat rotational systems (Rehman et al. 2014), which occupy over 14 million hectares (Erenstein 2009), as forgone profits resulting from high production costs can determine subsistence above or below the poverty line. Land preparation, tillage, and crop establishment are among the most energy consuming and costly agricultural operations incurred by cereal producers (Gathala et al. 2016; Raghu et al. 2016). Considerable research and development efforts have consequently been undertaken to develop and examine the potential for conservation tillage (CT) technologies and associated crop establishment techniques, which can reduce costs and increase farmers’ production efficiency, while maintaining stable yields (cf. Gathala et al. 2015). CT is an umbrella term used to describe a portfolio of tillage, crop establishment, and crop residue management systems that aim to conserve soil and water resources, while improving input use efficiency and hence productivity (Abdalla et al. 2013). Cost-savings therefore provide a major driver for CT adoption (Krishna and Veettil 2014). CT examples include zero- and strip-tillage, often with residues retained as mulch, machine-operated shallow-till seeding, and crop establishment on minimally tilled but raised beds reported to increase irrigation use efficiency (Aravindakshan et al. 2015; Gathala et al. 2016), an issue of importance given increasing water pumping costs in Bangladesh (Qureshi et al. 2015). These approaches share similarities with conservation agriculture (CA) that aims to consistently reduce or eliminate tillage (Gathala et al. 2015). But unlike conservation agriculture, farmers practicing CT may not completely eliminate tillage. CT farmers may also remove crop residues for feeding livestock or as cooking fuel (Aravindakshan et al. 2015). In the last decade, global area under CT has increased by an estimated 60% (Derpsch et al. 2010). The spread of CT has however been most rapid in North and South America, Southern Africa, and in Australia, primarily among larger and wealthier farmers, with less adoption by smallholder farmers (Derpsch et al. 2010). CT is nonetheless a popular technology favored by donors, NGOs, and research organizations in developing nations, and is consequently increasingly promoted as a cost-efficient method of cereal crop production. Several studies have analyzed the determinants of CT adoption in South Asia, though most focus on the western Indo-Gangetic Plains including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana in India, and the Punjab in Pakistan, where farmers tend to be wealthier and have larger field sizes (Krishna et al. 2012; Krishna et al. 2017). Conversely, the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), which is composed of Bangladesh and West Bengal and Bihar in India, tend to be more impoverished, with population densities exceeding 1200 people km−2 and considerably smaller field sizes (Erenstein and Thorpe 2011; World Bank 2016). While large production gains and reductions in rural poverty were accrued during the Green Revolution in the eastern IGP, a plateau in factor productivity has been recently been observed (Lin and Huybers 2012). This has retarded the pace of poverty reduction and signaled environmental concerns where inputs are used inefficiently (Erenstein and Thorpe 2011). Alternative approaches that improve smallholder efficiency, productivity, and profitability may however accelerate poverty reduction process in eastern IGP. CT may therefore have a role to play, while also helping to mitigate environmental externalities and input use inefficiencies pre-requisite for sustainable profitability increases (Derpsch et al. 2010; Krishna et al. 2012). The technological efficiency of CT in the poverty-dense eastern IGP has only recently begun to be studied (cf. Keil et al. 2015), although the potential for biases resulting from self-selection in farmers’ technology choices has been insufficiently addressed. This paper therefore responds to this problem, by addressing and overcoming the potential for such confounding artifacts in CT assessments. Available literature reveals three major shortcomings of CT technical efficiency studies. Firstly, previous researchers have presented CT as a single technology, although the term is more appropriate as an umbrella for a number of associated tillage and crop establishment techniques (Abdalla et al. 2013). Studies that have isolated CT into individual tillage options have conversely indicated the risk of self-selection bias (cf. Aravindakshan et al. 2015). Bias resulting from the random selection of villages and households may also be problematic (cf. Krishna and Veettil 2014), as randomization may not ensure an adequate sample of CT adopters and non-adopters for robust analysis. Measured productivity and efficiency variances may therefore be attributed to self-selection rather than unbiased effect (Bravo-Ureta et al. 2012). Finally, few studies have assessed counterfactual effects among CT non-adopters, for example by estimating what efficiency gains may have been accrued had farmers adopted CT, and vice versa for non-adopters. In this paper, we analyze CT wheat farmers’ technical efficiency (TE) in a representative area of the eastern IGP in northwestern Bangladesh, while addressing the shortcomings of previous analyses. We consider three of the most popular CT technologies adopted by farmers, including bed planting (BP), strip tillage (ST), and reduced tillage machine-aided line sowing using a PTOS or power-tiller operated seeder (see Krupnik et al. 2013 for further description). These are contrasted with farmers’ traditional practices of repetitive tillage, broadcast seeding and crop establishment. The technical efficiency of CT compared to traditional tillage (TT) is analyzed using meta-technology ratios generated via a bootstrapped non-parametric meta-frontier approach that corrects for sampling errors. Bootstrapped truncated regressions are subsequently employed on group-specific efficiency scores to identify the factors affecting TE within tillage options. We subsequently employ endogenous switching regression to correct self-selection biases and to generate counterfactual scenarios. These are matched with meta-frontier technical efficiency scores to reconfirm the impact of farmers’ technology choices.",27

Stead,William H. Greene,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Frontier analysis is concerned with the measurement of efficiency relative to an estimated production or cost frontier. The presence of noise in the sample is potentially problematic in two ways: it affects the position of each decision making unit (DMU) relative to the frontier, and it affects the precision of the estimates of the shape of the frontier itself. The magnitudes of these effects vary from one method to another: deterministic methods, such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) (Charnes et al. 1978) and corrected ordinary least squares (COLS) are particularly sensitive, given that they make no allowance for noise. In contrast, Stochastic Frontier (SF) Analysis explicitly controls for noise, mitigating its impact on the estimated frontier and on individual efficiency scores. The range of efficiency scores may still be very large in the presence of data with outlying observations. In terms of empirical motivation for this paper, this paper is in response to the authors’ finding of an implausibly wide range of efficiency scores in our work studying cost drivers and cost efficiency in the highways maintenance operations of local authorities in England, which utilises detailed data on operating and capital expenditure provided by each authority. This can be narrowly explained as being due to a combination of under-reporting and over-reporting of expenditure, unobserved investment cycle effects, and extreme weather events. However we also came across this issue in a number of other datasets, across numerous sectors including hotels in Taiwan (Chen 2007), container ports (Cullinane et al. 2006), regional iron and steel production in China (Lin and Wang 2014), crop farms in Poland (Latruffe et al. 2004), French insurance companies (Fecher et al. 1993), Belgian municipalities (De Borger and Kerstens 1996), US banks (Bauer et al. 1998), and police forces in England and Wales (Drake and Simper 2003). In general, as observed by Gupta and Nguyen (2010), financial data are often heavy tailed. For example Berger and Humphrey (1991) observe heavy tailed distribution of costs in banking, an industry to which efficiency analysis is often applied. As such the issue in this paper has broad applicability across the performance literature. In this paper we outline and discuss the merits and empirical application of a new stochastic frontier model which accommodates the influence of outlying observations. This is the stochastic frontier model with a Student’s t distribution for the noise term. The advantages of this model over previous proposals lie in its flexibility, since the degree of kurtosis is no longer fixed but allowed to vary with the degrees of freedom parameter. In fact, the Student’s t distribution nests (or more precisely, contains as a limiting case) the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom parameter approaches infinity. For any given distribution of ui, our model encompasses the standard SF model. This enables testing down against the standard model, in contrast to previous proposals which utilise non-nested specifications, and lets the data determine the extent to which outlying observations influence the kurtosis of the noise error term. Thus our model is an original and significant contribution to the literature, not just in being able to better accommodate outlying observations in efficiency analysis relative to the standard SF model, but it is the first contribution to contain as a testable limiting case the standard SF model. As such our model provides a natural extension to the tools of practitioners in the field. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews existing methods available in the literature to handle a large number of outliers in frontier analysis. Section 3 introduces a t-truncated normal stochastic frontier model for dealing with heavy-tailed noise and discusses efficiency prediction. Testing of the normal distribution hypothesis is considered in Section 4. Section 5 presents Monte Carlo evidence on the performance of the maximum simulated likelihood estimator of the model. Section 6 applies the Student’s t-half normal model to data on highways maintenance costs in England and compares the results to those obtained from normal-half normal model, and Section 7 gives our summary and conclusions. Some technical results appear in the Appendices.",30

Until more recently, such approaches were presumed to have been largely a failure, summed-up by Cohen (2006, p. 88) as follows: “The standard criticism levelled against sectoral industrial policies is that the state has neither the necessary information nor adequate incentives to make better choices than the market… it tends to misestimate … the negative long-term effects of the protection granted to certain firms and the negative impacts of the benefits granted to promoted sectors on other sectors.” However, industrial policy is generally now regarded more favourably as shown by various contributions to recent books on the topic (e.g., Felipe 2015; Stiglitz and Lin 2013). Rather than just ‘believe’ in the market and allow economic success to be generated by globalisation allied to government intervention in support of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation, “… it has become obvious that all governments are engaged in various forms of industrial policies… (therefore) the question is not whether any government should use industrial policy but rather how to use industrial policy in the best way” (Stiglitz et al. 2013, pp. 5–6). China is perceived as a country that provides large-scale assistance to industry (Haley and Haley 2013). But was government assistance targeted at the right firms and sectors and at an appropriate level? A recent paper by Aghion et. al. (2015) investigated if the distribution of government assistance to firms in China enhanced productivity, finding that assistance was allocated to competitive sectors and /or fostered competition in a sectorFootnote 1 so enhancing productivity growth over the 1998–2007 period. Their approach was essentially to test if subsidies were correlated with initial competition levels, where the latter was measured using a Lerner index. They also measured the concentration of assistance across firms within each sector (using a Herfindahl index). Both the correlations obtained at the sector-city level (the Lerner indices) and the Herfindahl indices were regressed on firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) estimates obtained using an Olley–Pakes approach. Both measures were found to have positive and significant impacts on TFP, and this is taken as evidence that government assistance was targeted at the right firms and sectors. However, Aghion et al. (op. cit.) did not test directly whether receiving assistance had a direct impact on each firms’ TFP nor the extent of such assistance; if receiving assistance is found to lower firm-level TFP (at least for some categories of firms or at, say, high levels of assistance) then it may well be that overall industrial policy in China introduces distortions that increase misallocation and work against the productivity-enhancing effects associated with the (more macro-level) distribution of assistance. Whether assistance acts as a boost to investment and production, and the extent to which this improves/reduces efficiency and thus productivity growth, is largely an empirical issue. Thus a major contribution of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature, by introducing variables that measure the assistance (including tax ‘holidays’ and subsidies) received by each firm directly into production functions determining firm output and analysing the impact of the assistance on TFP at the firm-level. A system-GMM econometric approach is used to measure firm-level TFP (with the variables representing assistance instrumented by their lagged values). To check the robustness of our results, the impact of assistance is also tested using a production function approach based on ‘matching’ firms receiving assistance with those not receiving ‘treatment’ who nonetheless had very similar characteristics to the assisted sub-group (Imbens and Rubin 2015). Both sets of results indicate that across the 26 industries considered Chinese firms that received assistance had higher TFP during 1998–2007, although there is some evidence that too high a level of assistance has negative consequences for TFP, suggesting that ‘rent-seeking’ and/or the pursuit of profit is blunted when firms become too dependent on government help, especially when such help is tied to ‘political control’ by the state (which is the case in China as explained below). To justify such results, we provide a simple model in the appendix that sets out how this is consistent with economic theory. Apart from the Aghion et al. (2015) study, we are only aware of a study by Girma et al. (2009) who used the same database as we use (but only for 1999 to 2005) to consider whether subsidies boosted export sales for domestic firms in manufacturing (finding subsidies stimulated exporting intensities of existing exporters but had little impact on encouraging firms to enter exporting). The major differences with the current study are: we include all (and not just domestic) firms in manufacturing and utilities covering 1998–2007; the more important form of assistance provided through ‘tax holidays’ (as well as subsidies) is included; and our dependent variable is TFP. Other studies, mostly covering developed economies, that consider the impact of assistance on productivity are relatively scarce, usually relate only to labour productivity (not TFP) and have produced mixed results. For example, Irwin and Klenow (1996) found no impact on labour productivity of R&D subsidies for U.S. high-tech companies; for Japanese forestry, Managi (2010) found a negative relationship between subsidies and TFP; Einio (2014) reports no instantaneous impacts of R&D support programmes in Finland on productivity (although there is evidence of long-term gains); Huang (2015) shows that tax credit use among Taiwanese firms enhanced their productivity; while Koski and Pajarinen (2015) report that R&D subsidies had no statistically significant impact on labour productivity in Finnish firms during 2003–2010, although employment subsidies and other subsidies (the latter covering similar State aid instruments as included in the present study) were negatively related to output-per-worker.Footnote 2 The paper is set out as follows. In the next section we discuss the rationale for the (Chinese) government providing assistance to firms, where government aid can be central, state or local (or some combination of all three levels). In Section 3 we discuss briefly the form that assistance takes and present some background information on its importance to firms. Following this, we estimate industry-level production functions using system-GMM and a ‘matching’ approach, to test whether assistance impacted on the level of TFP across firms. In Section 5 we decompose the growth of TFP and relate it to assistance and the extent of formal political connections between firms and the government. The paper concludes with a summary and some ideas for further research that would extend the approach taken in this paper.",8

Greene,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Total factor productivity (TFP) is the major determinant of economic growth (Krugman 1997) and particularly important for export-dependent countries. The reason for this essentiality is that high operation efficiency and technology development are necessary for competitiveness in an international market. A slowdown in labor productivity growth can be observed in a large share of the industrialized countries and Sweden performed worse than other OECD countries after 2007 (OECD 2015). Moreover, the productivity difference within sectors has increased according to Andrews et al. (2016). Furthermore, potential catch-up after a financial crisis is of particular importance because Cerra and Saxena (2008) showed that the per capita income ranking has fell for several countries after a financial crisis, e.g. for Sweden after the banking crisis in the early 1990s. Even though TFP is a driving force for economic growth that is likely to be affected during economic downturns—it has hardly been investigated during the financial crisis 2008–2009 and the following period. The manufacturing sector is of specific importance, due to its export dependence and potential for spill-over into other sectors (Kaldor 1966). In addition, several studies show that negative TFP shocks within manufacturing are the primary cause of economic stagnations (see e.g., Fukao and Kwon 2006). Sweden went from one of the weakest countries, (in terms of labor productivity) within the OECD area to being one of the strongest during the period 1992–2002, which Oh et al. (2012) analyzed. In the early 1990s, Sweden abandoned the fixed exchange rate, which is, at least partly, the explanation for the increase in competitive power during this period (Bergvall 2002). The aim of this paper are: (a) to examine TFP and its decomposed factors before, during and after the financial crisis in 2008–2009; (b) to analyse the level of technical efficiency. A four-component stochastic frontier model (SFM) for the Swedish manufacturing industry is applied for the period 1997–2013, which permits analysis of a potential catching-up following the crisis. For comparison purpose, the domestic service sector is incorporated in the analysis since it, potentially, is less affected by changes in world demand. Additional to the empirical analysis, a question is raised regarding interpretation of TC in stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). To investigate and compute TFP and its components, we use the SFM that was simultaneously proposed by Colombi et al. (2014), Kumbhakar et al. (2014) and Tsionas and Kumbhakar (2014). In this model, inefficiency is decomposed into a persistent and a transient component separated from firm-heterogeneity and random noise, respectively. This separation is interesting of several reasons. First, productivity differences are shown to be increased by Andrews et al. (2016), which is closely related to the topic of efficiency in SFA. Second, it gives insights whether firms with a low level of persistent efficiency drop out from the market after the financial crisis. Third, the transient part of efficiency would become lower if existing firms perform worse during and after the financial crisis. Additionally, technical change (TC), returns to scale (RTS) and a scale change (SC) component are also identified. The TFP change is obtained as the sum of TC and SC, where TC represent a shift of the production function and SC indicates movements towards or away from optimal scale. To be noted is that this type of identification procedure does not separate the change of technical efficiency from TC as performed in, for example, Bauer (1990). Our findings show improvement potentials in efficiency. The persistent part for manufacturing (service) is 0.796 (0.754) and the transient part 0.787 (0.762). Both the manufacturing and the private-service sector had a decline in efficiency during the financial crisis, but it was smaller for the service sector. During the post-crisis period, firms within both sectors caught up to the level of efficiency they had before. Furthermore, the manufacturing (service) had an annual average TFP growth of 1.17% (1.24%) measured over the whole period. However, substantial differences are observed in TFP change over time when separating the time-periods; i.e., 1997–2007 and 2007–2013, respectively. The manufacturing sector has a TFP growth of 1.98%, and the service sector, 1.80%, during the former period, i.e. before the crisis. This can be compared with 0.44 and 0.54% in the latter. This difference between the pre- and post-periods is statistically significant on the 1% level. However, it should be stated that a causal interpretation between the financial crisis and a lower TFP growth cannot be made. Additionally, a pure separation, whether this is driven by inefficient firms or frontier firms, cannot be performed, i.e. the production function can be pushed towards the origin by inefficient firms. Nevertheless, for manufacturing, the lower transient efficiency during the financial crisis can still be observed when time is indicated by year fixed effects, meaning that firms with low efficiency affect TC, at least, to some extent. However, due to the lower TC during 2007–2013, policy makers should target interventions that enhance technology, e.g., increasing the attractiveness of innovating. In addition, care should be taken when designing these policies so they do not sustain low-productive firms that would otherwise close down. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The background of this study is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, different ways of measuring efficiency and TFP, with a focus on stochastic frontier models and interpretation, are described. The methodology used in this paper is presented in Section 4. Section 5 considers the data, and the results are presented in section 6. Finally, section 7 concludes and provides policy recommendations.",9

Balk,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This introductionFootnote 1 sketches the context. The first article of this series, Balk (2010), considered productivity measurement for a single, consolidated production unit. In terms of levels, productivity is defined as real output divided by real input. Real output or input means nominal output or input deflated by some output- or input-specific price index, respectively. For the production unit considered, productivity change (through time) can then be measured as a difference or a ratio of productivities. In the latter case it appears that productivity change can also be defined directly as output quantity index divided by input quantity index. The choice of the output and input concepts appears to be critical. Three main models can be distinguished: KLEMS-Y, KL-VA, and K-CF. Taking the composition of capital input cost into account, as set out in the companion paper Balk (2011), two more models can be added, namely KL-NVA and K-NCF. Assuming profit (defined as revenue minus total cost) to be equal to zero, or, what amounts to the same, replacing an exogenous interest rate by an endogenous rate, multiplies the number of models by two. And the introduction of a capital utilization rate further complicates the picture. Thus, there is a lot of choice here, with not unimportant empirical consequences, as illustrated by Vancauteren et al. (2012). Production units exist at various levels of aggregation. We see plants, enterprises, industries, countries, to name just some types of production units materializing in analyses of productivity change. Usually such units appear, more or less naturally, arranged into higher level aggregates. For instance, a number of plants belonging to the same enterprise; a certain type of enterprises defining an industry; a number of industries defining the ‘measurable’ part of a national economy; national economies making up the world economy. It is not difficult to perceive several sorts of hierarchy here. As in any of these situations the structure is the same—there is an ensemble of production units, and the ensemble itself may or may not be considered as a higher level production unit –, it is interesting to study the relation between aggregate productivity (change) and productivity (change) of the aggregate. There are basically two approaches here. Balk (2016) reviews and discusses the so-called bottom-up approach, the approach that takes an ensemble of individual production units as the fundamental frame of reference. The top-down approach is the subject of three other papers, namely Balk (2014) plus Dumagan and Balk (2016) on labour productivity, and Balk (2015) on total factor productivity. The connection between the two approaches is considered in Balk (2018a). The present paper basically continues Balk (2015). In the 2015 paper three (time-) symmetric decompositions of aggregate value-added based total factor productivity change were developed. In the present paper a fourth decomposition will be developed. A notable difference with the earlier paper is that the development is cast in terms of levels rather than indices. This paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 refreshes the accounting framework; nothing new there. Value-added based total factor productivity is defined as real value added divided by real primary input; hence, Section 3 defines these two concepts. Section 4 shows that aggregate value-added based total factor productivity change essentially consists of three components: a weighted mean of individual value-added based total factor productivity changes, a factor reflecting reallocation between the production units, and a factor reflecting relative price changes at the input and output sides. Section 5 shows how the reallocation factor can be decomposed further into the contributions of the separate primary inputs. Section 6 shows how the decomposition derived in Section 4 changes if value-added based productivity change is replaced by gross-output based productivity change. Section 7 contains a key result: under mild restrictions on the relation between aggregate and individual deflators, if profit equals 0 then the reallocation factor vanishes, and aggregate value-added based total factor productivity change equals the product of Domar-weighted individual gross-output based total factor productivity changes. In Section 8 we take a further step by assuming that the production units share the same time-invariant production function. We then obtain a decomposition in terms of technical efficiency change, scale and mix effects.",2

Førsund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A crucial building block in environmental economics is the phenomenon of joint generation of intended outputs and unintended onesFootnote 1 in production and consumption activities. The discharge of unintended outputs causes the ubiquitous environmental problems facing humankind today. Estimation of efficiency and productivity when producing both intended and unintended outputs has emerged as an important research strand. However, mainstream environmental economics has hardly considered inefficiency issues. The literature spawned by the Porter hypothesis (Porter (1991); Porter and van den Linde 1995) is an exception (empirical studies and critique of the hypothesis are extensively reviewed in Brännlund and Lundgren (2009); Lanoie et al. (2011); Ambec et al. 2013). Based within the inefficiency research strand Färe et al. (1986); (1989) pioneered the issue of measuring inefficiency empirically when producers generate both desirable and undesirable outputs. The measurement was based on theoretical schemes presented in Shephard (1970), that introduced jointly weak disposability of intended and unintended outputs, and null jointness.Footnote 2 Färe and Grosskopf (1983) developed the theoretical ideas into explicit efficiency measuresFootnote 3 using single-equations distance functions presented in Shephard (1970). Up to now, single-equation models have completely dominated the literature on efficiency when producing simultaneously intended and unintended outputs. The introduction of a directional distance function in Chung et al. (1997) lead to the widespread adoption of this approach in the literature, and replaced the hyperbolic efficiency measure used in Färe et al. (1989). The output-oriented radial distance function of Shephard (1970) was generalised using a distance function that adds to the desirable output of an inefficient observation and subtracts from the observed inefficient level of the undesirable output in order for a projection of the observation to be on the frontier. The calculation of the added/subtracted values where done using the same scalar factor multiplied with the observed values of both types of outputs, using as the direction of scaling the observed output values. The rise of the Shephard single-equation models of joint production of intended and unintended outputs in journals has been rather spectacular, with Färe et al. (1989) having 903 citations and Chung et al. (1997) having 1001 citations in Web of Science per 20.07.2020. However, critical journal papers offering other approaches are coming (see Førsund (2009); Murty et al. (2012); Murty and Russell (2018) and extensive surveys in Murty and Russell (2017); Dakpo and Ang 2019). A crucial feature of the technology specification is the unavoidability of generation of residuals. I am only interested in the residuals that cause environmental damage, identified as having positive willingness to pay to reduce the damage.Footnote 4 Residuals are then called pollutants. The materials balance, introduced in environmental economics in Ayres and Kneese (1969), expresses the essential insight that the material content of inputs cannot disappear, but must be part of the intended outputs or become residuals discharged to the natural environment.Footnote 5 The materials balance reflects the two thermodynamic laws of conservation of matter and energy. Due to entropy, there is a minimum of energy and materials that will not be contained in the intended output. The pervasiveness of residuals generation then follows. The seminal papers Färe et al. (1989); Chung et al. (1997) answered the question of how to calculate efficiency measures when both intended and unintended outputs are produced. This achievement was impressive. However, the single-equation Shephard distance function they used are not without flaws, and were first criticized in Førsund (1998); (2009) and more forcefully in Murty and Russell (2002); Murty et al. (2012). The main purpose of the paper is to expose the problems of Shephard-inspired measures, and to present an approach based on a specific form of joint production based on Frisch (1965), developed further in Førsund (2009); (2018a). The alternative approaches both in Førsund (2009) and Murty et al. (2012) are based on a separation of the technology into two types of production functions; one for intended outputs and another for unintended outputs.Footnote 6 However, the two types of outputs are not produced in separate activities, but generated simultaneously. Murty et al. (2012) provided solid mathematical arguments for the necessity of operating with multi equations rather than with a single equation that was used employing distance functions. My critique is not based so much on technical or mathematical insights as to an understanding of how to model the production relationships for an intended output when the creation of unavoidable unintended products causing negative externalities are also produced simultaneously. For the analysis, I will use mostly production functions with continuous partial derivatives of first and second order, and assuming that the requisite assumptions of the implicit function theorem hold. Of course, these are stricter assumptions than necessary. Starting out with some reasonable assumptions or axioms about production sets and then deriving their properties will yield richer results as to the generality of the analysis, and may be required for disentangling disposal properties of multiple equations (Murty et al. (2012); Murty and Russell (2017); 2018). However, it is not necessary for my purpose to go for maximal generality. The plan of the paper is to discuss the materials balance in Section 2, and to present the seminal approaches of Shephard (1970) and Baumol and Oates (1988) in Section 3. The nature of joint production and my alternative to the Shephard-inspired models are presented and discussed in Section 4 together with short reviews of alternative multi-equation models. The key model development in the paper is based on the factorially determined multi- output production functions of Frisch (1965). Section 5 is summing up the critique of Shephard-inspired models. Section 6 discusses the efficiency concept and points to a simple way to estimate efficiency and productivity measures in the case of both intended and unintended outputs using a radial non-parametric DEA model. Section 7 concludes.",8

Førsund,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Acknowledging that I and Murty and Russell (2002), Murty, Russell and Levkoff (2012), followed by several other papers, have developed a model with two separate production functions, Rolf and Shawna leave the discussion of separate production functions to Murty and Russell. Instead they focus on the discussion of the ‘Shephard inspired approach’ and its development since the 1980’s with focus on specification and linkage of production and abatement nodes in a network, and how the network model can be regarded equivalent to multi equation models. They provide a unifying framework for modelling goods and bads by specifying multiple sub technologies which can be linked and estimated with a distance function. Concerning the single equation model inspired by Shephard (1970) I do not insist that the Frisch inspired factorially determined multi output production function is necessary, but it is sufficient to capture joint production of the type that production of bads is unavoidable. The two types of production functions in Equation (9) in my paper do not represent two independent functions; xM must be the same in both equations. To split into two functions a process that happens simultaneously is done in order to state that the amount of the good output is independent of the amount of the bad output and vice versa. Process engineers will probably not find it interesting in an engineering sense, for them the importance is to design a process that maximises the amount of good output and minimises the bad output for given non- material and material inputs. I regard the f(.) and g(.) functions as frontier functions where the good y is the maximal amount produced by f(xM, xS) and the bad z is the minimal amount produced by g(xM) when you have the condition that z is greater or equal to the frontier value given xM. I see no problem here, cf. the shape of cost functions. Looking at Fig. 1 in Rolf and Shawna comment it seems that inputs are distributed on subtechnologies P1 and P2. The authors say that “P1 could represent the subtechnology producing good output, and P2 the subtechnology producing unintended bad output”. However, this is not compatible with what I define as joint production. In my understanding of unavoidable joint production of bads we must have x0 = x01 = x02 (valid for xM0); by definition of technical jointness (Frisch 1965) you cannot produce the good outputs without simultaneously producing the bads. The authors quote from my paper where I state that I am only interested in “residuals jointly with good outputs, where the residuals cause environmental damage, identified as positive willingness to pay to reduce the damage”. They seem to claim by an illustration in their Fig. 2 that in that case no bads will be produced; bads are disposable. However, my point, made already in Førsund (2009), is that if you have assorted production (Frisch 1965), i.e. inputs can be reallocated to different outputs also including bads, then it will not be optimal to produce any bads. My point is that you must have the case of technically joint production (Frisch 1965) in order to capture the situation with unavoidable bads, or as introduced in Murty et al. (2012), costly disposability. The authors are introducing null-jointness of the good and the bad. This is not wrong for most cases, however, in my view the basic information is the connection between the material inputs and good and bad outputs. If nothing can be produced without material inputs, both goods and bads will be zero. The relationships between goods and bads go through material inputs. However, it may be the case that the bad output is zero even when the use of material input is positive. If a carpenter sources the right dimensions of planks from a sawmill he can make a very rough wooden table without creating any residuals within his workshop; positive material input is essential for positive good output, but no bad is created. Concerning the limit of the bad in my paper this is based on the limit of the use of material inputs. I use these basic input limits in the bads function g(.) in my modelling. Rolf and Shawna pioneered networks models starting with Färe and Grosskopf (1996). The focus was on independent firms selling intermediate outputs to firms producing the final outputs. Efficiency scores could then be calculated for each plant in the chain. Now the focus is on subtechnologies within the same plant. They suggest that by creating an internal network model for subtechnologies can have a common ground with using two separate model types. I think this is a good idea, because subtechnology P1 in Fig. 1 can represent the production of the good and the gross bad using two production functions as in Eq. (9) in my paper. Subtechnology P2 representing abatement (treatment) can be modelled by adding an abatement function discharging the net bad (see e.g. Førsund (2009) where an abatement function with the net pollutant as the product and the gross output as an input together with relevant material and non-material and inputs).",1

(1986, 1989) were the first to introduce undesirable outputs (bad outputs) into an empirical production model, allowing for inefficiencies. They treat bad outputs as weakly disposable outputs; (ii) Hailu and Veeman (2001) model bad outputs as strongly disposable inputs; (iii) Lovell et al. (1995) and Seiford and Zhu (2002) transform bad outputs and model the transformed values as strongly disposable outputs; (iv) the eco-efficiency approach by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005) ignores inputs and only considers good and bad outputs; (v) recently, the by-production approach that models polluting technology as the intersection of multiple sub-technologies has been introduced (Murty et al. 2012) and extended (Serra et al. 2014; Dakpo 2016; Ray et al. 2018; Lei 2020), and its application has gained popularity (see e.g., Dakpo et al. 2017; Ait Sidhoum et al. 2020).Footnote 1 All these approaches have been criticized for various reasons (see, e.g., Färe and Grosskopf 2004; Førsund 2009; Dakpo et al. 2016; Førsund 2018; Hampf 2018). The most widely applied approaches, for example, (i) and (ii), are criticized for not complying with physical laws (i.e., the materials balance principle, law of mass conservation, or first law of thermodynamics) and for allowing for physically impossible production possibilities (Färe and Grosskopf 2003; Coelli et al. 2007; Førsund 2009; Hoang and Coelli 2011; Podinovski and Kuosmanen 2011; Rødseth 2017). To overcome this problem, Coelli et al. (2007) and Rødseth (2017) introduced production models that insure consistency with the materials balance principle.Footnote 2 These models rely on the materials balance equation (MBE), an accounting identity that describes the relationship between potentially polluting by-products (residuals) of a production process, the amount of inputs used, and the amount of good outputs produced. Residuals (i.e., pollutants or bad outputs), inputs and good outputs are linked by material flow coefficients (MFCs) such that the amount of materials tied up in the inputs must equal the amount of the flow of materials embedded in intended outputs plus residuals. Due to non-homogeneity in inputs and outputs and the role of some external factors, the MFCs may differ from one decision-making unit (DMU) to another (Dakpo et al. 2016). Although the MBE-based models have been applied in numerous efficiency analyses, especially in agriculture (see e.g., Hoang and Rao 2010; Hoang and Coelli 2011; Hoang and Alauddin 2012; Nguyen et al. 2012; Hoang and Nguyen 2013) and energy generation (see e.g., Welch and Barnum 2009; Hampf and Rødseth 2015, 2017, 2019), heterogeneous MFCs have received little attention in the literature. An exception is Hampf and Rødseth (2019). Their model accommodates heterogeneous MFCs that reflect differences in input qualities across DMUs. They assume that the input quality can be freely chosen by DMUs and, as such, the MFCs are considered controllable. The study at hand extends the Coelli et al. (2007) model and the weak G-disposability technology introduced by Rødseth (2017), allowing for heterogeneous MFCs which reflect differences of some non-discretionary, environmental/external factors. These models can also be applied to situations where input and output quality is heterogeneous across DMUs but non-controllable (i.e., input or output quality switching, such as fuel switching from coal to gas is not possible). Contrary to that of Hampf and Rødseth (2019), the approach presented in this article accounts for emission abatement activities that require the use of additional inputs. While network technologies (see e.g., Färe et al. 2013; Hampf 2014; Lozano 2015; Bostian et al. 2016, 2019; Bi et al. 2018) separately model the production and the abatement stages, our approach models the amount of abated emission as strongly disposable output together with all other inputs and outputs in a single stage. Inputs are jointly consumed by desirable output production and emission control. Hence, the procedure does not require information on the amount of inputs devoted to each of these processes. Based on these extended production models, conditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators of environmental efficiency (EE) are proposed that (i) reward emission reductions from emission control and (ii) control for environmental factors influencing the production of the bad output. The latter is achieved by introducing conditional technology sets that depend on non-discretionary factors and restrict the reference set of the DMUs under evaluation to DMUs that face comparable environments (cf. Ruggiero 1996, 1998). This guarantees that differences in EE are not confused with differences in non-discretionary factors. The presented procedure is a generalization of the MBE-based approach introduced by Coelli et al. (2007). It is shown that the Coelli et al. (2007) measure is a special case of the EE measures proposed here. Similarly to Rødseth (2016) and Wang et al. (2018), the EE measures are decomposed into three components that reveal the sources of inefficiencies with regard to emission generation. Taking the production of desirable outputs as given, the components reflect inefficiencies associated with (i) too low of an amount of abated emission for the given amount of inputs used, (ii) too much usage and misallocation of polluting inputs, and (iii) an unfavorable allocation between polluting and non-pollution inputs. The approach is illustrated by an empirical application to arable farming using data from 90 Austrian crop farms for the year 2011, and considering soil erosion by water as an unintended, potentially polluting by-product that should be minimized. Soil erosion results from energy transmitted from wind or rainfall and leads to the loss of topsoil and soil organic matter, which are essential for plant growth. Soil erosion is the most important cause of soil degradation, which is recognized as one of the most pressing problems facing humanity (Young et al. 2015) and a serious threat to sustainable development as envisaged in the European Union (EU) Sustainable Development Strategy (EC 2001) and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (Griggs et al. 2013; Keesstra et al. 2018). The private and social costs of soil erosion are considerable, including reduced soil productivity and off-site effects, such as sedimentation, flooding, landslides, and water eutrophication (Pimentel et al. 1995; Adhikari and Nadella 2011; Graves et al. 2015; Panagos et al. 2018). Clearly, agriculture plays a key role, as agricultural land accounts for 68.3% of total soil loss in Europe (Panagos et al. 2015c). Considering that actual soil erosion rates for tilled, arable land in Europe are, on average, 3–40 times greater than the upper limit of tolerable soil erosion (Verheijen et al. 2009), the application gains particular importance. Besides farmers’ land use and management decisions, including crop choice and applied erosion control measures, the degree of soil loss mainly depends on exogenous environmental (non-discretionary) factors, such as rainfall quantity and intensity, soil texture and structure, and slope gradient and length. To the best of my knowledge, attempts to consider soil erosion as undesirable output in empirical production models are restricted to frontier eco-efficiency studies (see Picazo-Tadeo et al. 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Eder et al. 2021) in the mode of Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005), an approach that completely ignores inputs and fails to capture all the input substitution possibilities that could help to optimize environmental performance (Dakpo et al. 2016). Hence, this is the first study modeling soil erosion as an undesirable output within a production theoretical framework that simultaneously accounts for inputs, desirable outputs, and undesirable outputs.",

Oumer,Amin Mugera,Atakelty Hailu,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The specification and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, first introduced by Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977), has evolved rapidly during the last decades. A range of cross-sectional and panel data stochastic frontier (SF) models have emerged that are commonly applied in empirical research to estimate technical efficiency. The abundance of choices of SF models and their underling different assumptions often makes it empirically challenging for policy analysts to select the most appropriate model to suit their data and this has implications for the estimated technical efficiency scores as well as model production function parameters. Given the interest in technical efficiency measures in policy discussions, there is a need to examine the robustness of results generated from competing SF models under varying production contexts while accounting for firm heterogeneity (Abdulai and Tietje 2007; Kumbhakar et al. 2014; Van Nguyen et al. 2021). In this paper, we focus on analysing the technical efficiency of smallholder farmers in a developing country production context. Analysis of smallholder farm efficiency can provide economic insights on how well available resources are used to produce food crops in developing countries. High levels of technical efficiency may imply best use of inputs to produce outputs that are close to what is technically possible given the prevailing production technology. Farms that are technically efficient are the ones that fully utilise the available production know how. Thus, efficiency measures offer useful insights into the competitiveness of farm households (Abdulai and Tietje 2007; Coelli et al. 2005; Kumbhakar et al. 2015). Such insights are vital for designing effective policy programmes to reduce resource wastage and increase enterprise output and productivity. Stochastic frontier (SF) models have been widely used to measure the technical efficiency of farm households. The stochastic production frontier model has two parts, the deterministic production function part and the stochastic part with technical inefficiency and random noiseFootnote 1. Technical efficiency estimates are sensitive to assumptions implied by different SF models and how firm heterogeneity is treated (Caudill and Ford 1993; Caudill et al. 1995; Kumbhakar and Lovell 2000; Kumbhakar et al. 2014). Consequently, different SF models can produce inconsistent technical efficiency estimates. When estimating SF models with panel data, disentangling firm heterogeneity from inefficiency is crucial for accurate efficiency estimate but challenging in practice because of the complexity of distinguishing the two (Greene 2004, 2005a). StochasticFootnote 2 frontier panel models can be used to separate firm effects from inefficiency measures that otherwise would be confounded in cross-sectionalFootnote 3 models. In the literature, two types of stochastic frontier panel models that differ in how they treat firm effects have been advanced. The first type of models treats firm effects as part of overall inefficiency with two components, the persistent (time-invariant/long-run) inefficiency and transient (time-variant/short-run) inefficiency (Battese 1992; Kumbhakar and Hjalmarsson 1993, 1995; Kumbhakar 1990; Kumbhakar and Heshmati 1995). The second type of models treat firm effects as firm heterogeneity (Greene 2005a, b; Kumbhakar and Wang 2005; Wang and Ho 2010) and assume only transient inefficiencyFootnote 4. Models that lump firm effects with inefficiency might produce an upward bias in inefficiency estimates (Abdulai and Tietje 2007; Colombi et al. 2014; Filippini and Greene 2016; Greene 2004, 2005b; Kumbhakar et al. 2014; Tsionas and Kumbhakar 2014). This bias can be severe if firm effects are related to the structure of the production technology but not to the inefficiency component (Colombi et al. 2014). However, if firm effects are related to inefficiency and not to the structure of the production technology, the models can adequately capture firm effects as persistent inefficiency in addition to the transient inefficiency. Hence, these models are adequate in estimating overall inefficiency. The second type of models only assume transient inefficiency by treating all firm effects as firm heterogeneity and are likely to produce inefficiency estimates that are downward biased. The downward bias can be severe if persistent technical inefficiency exists but is erroneously attributed to firm heterogeneity (Colombi et al. 2014). The objective of this paper is to examine the variability in technical efficiency estimates computed using stochastic frontier panel models that take different approaches to account for firm heterogeneity in the deterministic production function and the inefficiency effect component. The focus of the empirical analysis is on maize producing smallholder farms in Ethiopia. The goal is not to give a comprehensive review of stochastic frontier panel models or to recommend a particular ‘winning’ model. Instead, we apply a selection of competing SF models to a single data set to illustrate how technical efficiency estimates may differ depending on how the model used treats both observed and unobserved firm heterogeneity and how this might affect policy inferences that can be drawn from such measures. Empirical studies that evaluate a broad set of stochastic frontier models in the agricultural production sector are rare. Two notable exceptions are Kumbhakar et al. (2014) for the Norwegian grain farms and Abdulai and Tietje (2007) for Germany dairy farms. We contribute to this line of literature with an application of stochastic frontier panel models to maize producing smallholder households in Ethiopia. Thus, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper empirically addresses the long-standing subject of estimating technical efficiency of smallholder farmers in a developing country context. Second, the paper investigates the sensitivity of technical efficiency estimates across competing SF models, particularly in the assumptions of the error term accounting for inefficiency. There is more heterogeneity across farm households in sub-Saharan Africa compared to farms in developed countries such as Norway and Germany due to diverse agro-ecological, climatic, socio-economic, and institutional factors, which makes such an empirical application particularly appropriate. This study is the first application in a developing country in sub-Saharan Africa. We apply the models to a nationally representative panel data set collected in 2009/2010 and 2012/2013 across 39 districts, and 183 kebelesFootnote 5. Our analysis reveals that estimated technical efficiency are sensitive to the way both unobserved and observed heterogeneity (measured environmental variables) are treated in estimation as well as to the distributional assumptions made about inefficiency. The results show that random effects (RE) panel models that treat firm effects as part of overall inefficiency to provide reliable efficiency estimates in contrast to ‘true’ random effects (TRE) panel models that treat these firm effects as firm heterogeneity. Further, the estimates from TRE models mimic the simple pooled SF models that ignore firm effects and do not distinguish between persistent and transient efficiency. The GTRE model reveals evidence of differences in persistent inefficiency and transient inefficiency across farm households, a pattern that is picked by the RE models but not by the TRE models or the simpler pooled frontier models. Incorporating observed heterogeneity (measured as environmental variables) in the variance rather than in the mean specification for the RE model inefficiency term, or both in the mean and the variance specifications, produces coefficient estimates that are consistentFootnote 6 with those from the basic truncated-normal RE model where both the mean and the variance of the inefficiency term are assumed constant. Likewise, controlling for environmental factors which are beyond the control of farm operators in the deterministic production function provides consistent technical efficiency estimates across RE models. All the estimated models yield consistent production function parameters (i.e., output elasticity, marginal productivity of inputs, input interaction effects and returns to scale)Footnote 7. The results suggest that the way heterogeneity is treated in the SF models manifests itself more in the measured technical inefficiency scores rather than in the estimates of the production function. The empirical results underscore the importance of considering the underlying assumptions of SF models under varying contexts before drawing any policy inferences. For example, practitioners may choose models that control for environmental factors affecting production but are beyond the control of the farm operator (e.g., rainfall, temperature etc.) in the deterministic production function. However, the factors under the control of the farm operator should be controlled for in the inefficiency effect component. Following this approach appears to greatly improve model consistency as different SF models predict similar efficiency levels and partial effects for exogenous factors. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section presents the methodology with a description of empirical models and estimation strategies. These are followed by a brief description of the data and variables used for the analysis. We present and discuss results in the third section. The article then concludes by drawing some empirical insights.",2

Podinovski,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the literature on data envelopment analysis (DEA), it has long been realized that the standard constant and variable returns-to-scale (CRS and VRS) production technologies of Banker (1984) and Charnes et al. (1978) are not suitable for the situations in which some inputs and outputs are represented by ratio measures—see, e.g., Dyson et al. (2001). Ratio inputs and outputs typically represent ratios of volume measures expressed in the form of percentages and averages. The reason for this is that, in contrast with volume measures, the use of ratio inputs and outputs is generally inconsistent with the axiom of convexity assumed in both VRS and CRS technologies. In the case of CRS, the use of ratio measures generally violates the additional assumption that decision making units (DMUs) can be proportionally scaled by a nonnegative scaling factor. To illustrate this problem, consider the following example. Suppose that, in the assessment of efficiency of schools, output y1 represents all students and output y2 represents students with good academic achievements in the school-leaving exams. Let the additional output y3 represent the percentage of students with good academic achievements, calculated based on the values of the volume outputs y1 and y2. Table 1 shows the above three outputs for the two observed schools A and B. Consider only the volume outputs y1 and y2 and assume that schools A and B operate in either VRS or CRS technology. Then any convex combination of these schools is also in the corresponding technology. For example, the simple average of schools A and B, shown as the hypothetical (unobserved) school C in Table 1, is included in both technologies. The correct percentage of students with good academic achievements is 45/150, or 30%. Note that if we simply include the ratio output y3 in the VRS or CRS technology, then, by averaging this output of schools A and B, we obtain an overestimated, and hence unsubstantiated, value of 40%. This example shows that, if we include ratio outputs (and, similarly, inputs) in the standard VRS or CRS technology, then such measures in the hypothetical DMUs will generally be incorrect. A special case arises in which the analyst has access to the volume measures used in the numerator and denominator of the ratio inputs and outputs. For this scenario, Emrouznejad and Amin (2009) developed an approach in which the assumption of convexity applies separately to the known numerators and denominators used in the ratio measures. However, this approach cannot be employed when the volume measures used as the numerator and denominator of the ratio input or output are unavailable. In two recent papers, Olesen et al. (2015, 2017) developed two different models of technology, referred to as the ratio-VRS (R-VRS) and ratio-CRS (R-CRS) technologies, in which ratio inputs and outputs are used “as is”, without any decomposition to the underlying volume numerator and denominator. Both technologies satisfy a generalized variant of the standard axiom of convexity known as selective convexity (Podinovski 2005). The R-VRS and R-CRS technologies allow conventional convex combinations of the volume inputs and outputs, while at the same time taking the ratio inputs at their maximal level, and ratio outputs at the minimal level, across all combined DMUs. The R-CRS technology also uses a generalization of the standard axiom of scalability, referred to as “ray unboundedness” by Banker et al. (1984), according to which the volume inputs and outputs are scaled with a nonnegative parameter in the conventional way, while the treatment of ratio measures is different and depends on their assumed type. Of particular practical significance is the R-CRS technology in which all ratio inputs and outputs are of the fixed type. Such technology is suitable in situations in which ratio inputs and outputs represent environmental and other exogenously fixed factors (e.g., in applications to school performance, these could be the proportion of households with high income or percentage of students with special needs) or quality of products of goods and services (e.g., the percentage of school leavers achieving good results in exams or success rate of treatments in a hospital). In all described situations, the R-CRS model with fixed ratio inputs and outputs assumes that it is possible to scale the volume inputs and outputs while keeping the environmental and quality measures constant.Footnote 1 Although the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies are based on transparent sets of axioms, their explicit mathematical statements are less intuitive. Olesen et al. (2015, 2017) establish several properties of these technologies and the models assessing the efficiency of DMUs based on them. However, the overall geometric structure of the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies has so far remained unclear. This in turn made some theoretical results (for example, the fact that both technologies are closed sets, which is one of the basic assumptions in production theory) formally correct but not sufficiently intuitive. In this paper, we explore the structure of the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies, the latter assuming that all ratio measures are of the fixed type. We prove that both technologies are the unions of a finite number of polyhedral sets. More precisely, in the case of R-VRS, these sets are the standard VRS technologies generated by different subsets of observed DMUs whose ratio inputs and outputs are modified in a particular way. In the case of R-CRS, these polyhedral sets are the partial cones obtained by scaling only volume measures of the similarly modified observed DMUs. We show that the new results obtained in this paper have various implications. In particular, these results should be useful for the exploration of the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies and their efficient frontiers. This includes the issues of classification of efficient DMUs, and sensitivity and stability of efficiency measures. The representations of the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies obtained in this paper are also useful as theoretical foundations for the correct definition of various frontier characteristics such as the most productive scale size, marginal rates and local returns to scale (RTS). We proceed as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic terminology and notation. In Section 3, we discuss production assumptions on which the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies are based and give statements of these technologies. In Sections 4 and 5 we obtain the main results that reveal the structure of the R-VRS and R-CRS technologies as finite unions of polyhedral sets. In Section 6, we outline some theoretical implications of our results. In Section 7, we provide concluding remarks. The proofs of all mathematical statements are given in the Appendix.",2

It is inspired by the two fundamental pillars enshrined in Article 32 of the Italian Constitution: universality and equality. While the principle of universality has never been questioned, the principle of equality, especially if broken down into terms of equality of services in the local territories, has been repeatedly overlooked in recent years. The last decade has been characterized by the profound financial crisis, exacerbating the economic differences between North and South (see about this aspect Lagravinese (2015)) with inevitable effects also on the demand and supply of health. Indeed, inequalities have started to increase again with evident effects on available healthcare resources, on the quality of uneven healthcare services, and on the living conditions of citizens. Since its introduction, and as in other European countries (see Costa-Font and Greer (2013)), the Italian NHS has undergone important reforms to decentralize health management and policy responsibilities to the sub-layers of government (Turati, 2013). As a result of a federal reform (Legislative Decree 56/2000), each region is in charge of organizing the health system, following the general guidelines defined by the central government that is responsible for setting the Essential Levels of Health Services (LEA, Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza).Footnote 1 However, the separation of financing from expenditure responsibilities in the provision of LEA, and before LEA in the provision of uniform levels of service, has provided a non-negligible incentive to the uncontrolled growth of Italian health expenditures and has historically contributed to creating bailing out expectations in regional behavior (Liberati, 2003), especially in a context of often inadequate regional health governance and accountability (Carinci et al., 2012). The public policies concerning a reduction in beds, in medical and nursing staff, hospital mergers and acquisitions as well as lower investments in infrastructure are now subject to revaluation in many countries. Even the decentralized organization itself is questioned and, in many cases, possible scenarios of re-centralization of the health system are well thought-out (Mosca, 2007). In this respect, Italy is among the western countries that have significantly reduced healthcare spending by reshaping its hospital organization and decentralizing management at regional level. The effects of these policies are still controversial to this day, but what is undoubtedly an established fact is that the inequalities between the regional systems in these 20 years have not diminished. Furthermore, the recovery plans imposed by the central government in 2007 for the regions with high deficitsFootnote 2 have certainly favored the reduction of healthcare expenditures and have proved to be an effective mechanism for eliminating sub-national governments deficits (Bordignon et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there is still no clear consensus in the literature whether these plans, and in general the decentralization process, have also had an impact on increasing health inequalities between or within regions. Our work attempts to enrich this literature looking at how hospital efficiency (one of the pillar of health services restructuring by the regions) has changed over the last decade within and across regions. The economic literature has so far produced a rich and consolidated series of works to study hospital efficiency. As far as Italy is concerned, most of them have investigated if the efficiency has changed either with the introduction of new accounting systems, such as the use of the diagnostic-related groups (Barbetta et al., 2007, Cavalieri et al., 2018), or due to the ownership of hospitals (Cellini et al., 2000, Colombi et al., 2017, Daidone and D’Amico, 2009). To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that measure in a more holistic way how efficiency has changed over the years and whether the regional policies have actually reduced the differences in hospitals between and within regions. This paper attempts to fill this gap. In particular, the aim of the present study is threefold. The first contribution of the paper regards the methodology used to measure the efficiency of hospitals. Indeed, health performances are usually averaged across several dimensions to obtain a composite indicator useful for ranking and comparisons. However, the obtained average score can hide contrasting attitudes and specialisations, being a crucial issue the definition of a proper set of weights to aggregate different subjects.Footnote 3 We apply the benefit of doubt (BoD) approach to determine a composite index that considers the multi-dimensionality of the hospital outcome. As far as we know, the BoD has received scarce attention so far in the health care sector. Nonetheless, in the absence of information about value judgments, as it is the case of hospitals, the BoD methodology can be an useful tool to account for the complexity of the health care system (Matos et al., 2021). The BoD aggregates linearly quantitative performance sub-indicators into a single composite one using the combination of weights that is the most convenient for the evaluated hospital (Cherchye et al., 2007). This is done by implicitly assigning less (more) weight to those sub-indicators or aspects of performance that the particular hospital is relatively weak (strong) when compared with all others in the sample (Karagiannis and Paschalidou, 2017).Footnote 4 The high flexibility in terms of exogenous assumptions for setting weights, makes the BoD an appropriate approach to account for the specializations of individual hospitals. Secondly, the composite indicator generated by the BoD is then used as output in a metafrontier production function based on a stochastic frontier framework.Footnote 5 More specifically, we apply a two-step stochastic frontier approach recently developed by Huang et al. (2014), based on the idea that hospitals have access, potentially, to distinct production technologies in different time periods, being conditioned by several factors such as, for instance, environmental characteristics, regulation and the availability of resources. The analysis is carried out using hospital data over almost one decade: in 2007, the year before the great recession and when, with the introduction of the recovery plans, a number of regions had to substantially reconsider their offer on the territory and in 2016, the last year for which the data are available in detail for all Italian healthcare facilities. To account for the change in efficiency between the two years, the metafrontier has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies this methodology to the Italian hospital context. The main findings show that the primary source of inefficiency comes from managerial inefficiency especially for hospitals located in southern regions. The final contribution of the paper is an attempt to link the literature on the hospitals’ efficiency and inequality in the healthcare services at local level. The efficiency score distribution is employed to compute the Theil index (Theil, 1967), a perfect decomposable inequality index, to compare over time the inequality of the estimated efficiency between hospitals in the same region and between different regions. The results of this analysis allow us to make some more general considerations regarding the evolution of the healthcare services in Italy. The findings show a clear and persistent North-South gap in efficiency performances of hospitals along with an increase in the inequality in terms of efficiency between the areas of the country mostly determined by between region inequality. The empirical evidence provides helpful recommendations for policy makers regarding whether local level provision of hospital services need to be improved or whether the regional policies implemented in these years must be reconsidered in order to favor a convergence process. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the methodology employed, Section 3 presents the data and provides some descriptive statistics, Section 4 discusses the results both in the metafrontier and inequality analyses and finally, Section 5 concludes and offers some policy implications.",3

First, as banks are the largest providers of credit to companies and households in the euro area, boosting efficiency in the banking sector helps to ensure lower lending rates and higher lending volumes. Schlüter et al. (2012) and Shamshur and Weill (2019) find for European countries that more efficient banks have lower loan mark-ups and provide credit at lower interest rates, fostering access to credit and benefiting borrowers and the economy. Second, a more efficient banking sector improves the transmission of monetary policy. As such, monetary policy relaxation (for example) is associated with a larger increase in loans when the banking sector is more efficient (Jonas and King 2008).Footnote 1 Moreover, Schlüter et al. (2012) and Havranek et al. (2016) find that more efficient banks tend to smooth loan interest rates for their clients when market rates change, hence contributing to lower volatility in bank lending interest rates. Third, Dissanayake and Wu (2021) find that more efficient banking systems experienced lower stock market price volatility during the Covid-19 pandemic. And fourth, Fiordelisi et al. (2011) find that more inefficient banks tend to be riskier, in the sense that they have a higher default frequency, hence contributing to increase risks to financial stability. Boosting productivity in the euro area banking sector is also critical because banks have been struggling to maintain profitability since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and although profitability has recovered somewhat since then, it remains below the long-run cost of capital, estimated to be in the range of 8–10% (EBA 2018). Several factors acted as a drag on bank profitability. The low-interest-rate environment resulted in lower lending margins, and low-income diversification have put pressure on income growth. Moreover, the increase observed in legacy assets in several countries has also dragged on profitability, not only because they must be recognised and provisioned for, but also because they tie scarce capital without providing returns, absorbing operational capacity and incurring legal and administrative costs. A high cost-base is also to blame, which has been associated with extensive branch networks and overbanking. Returning banks to sustainable rates of profitability is important for several reasons. First, it ensures that the sector remains resilient, because profits are the first line of defence against losses from credit impairment, which increase in times of crisis. Second, low profitability prospects translate into low bank valuations, which hinder the ability of banks to raise equity capital. And third, banks with poor structural profitability are likely to face higher funding costs and may also be tempted to take on more risk (Babihuga and Spaltro 2014). Against the need to improve the health of the euro area banking sector, we study the performance of the banking system in the Eurozone over the period 2006–2017 as measured by total factor productivity growth (TFPG) and its components. The first one is overall technical efficiency (i.e., the minimisation of costs to generate a certain amount of output, for given input prices). The second one, technological progress, captures the decline (or increase) in total costs over time, for a given amount of output and input prices. The third component is the equity effect and captures the impact of equity ratios on total costs. The last one is the scale effect and captures the impact of output growth on average costs. All these components can be computed based on cost-efficiency frontier analysis. As a result, it is possible to isolate changes in productivity growth related to moving closer to the cost frontier, shifts in the frontier itself, cost reductions due to higher levels of equity and moving to a different part of the cost-efficiency frontier, respectively. Our contribution to the empirical literature is threefold. First, we quantify the four drivers of Total Factor Productivity growth for a large sample of euro area banks over a period that covers by and large the aftermaths of the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Focusing on this period is important because the euro area banking sector has been struggling to achieve structural profitability due to constraints in its capacity to increase revenue in a low-interest-rate environment, impediments to implement business models adjustments that allow for an increase in income other than interest revenue and downsize costs, and excess capacity. As a result, improving productivity could help re-build profits in the banking sector. Second, to the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that controls for unobserved bank heterogeneity and disentangles persistent and time-varying inefficiency in the euro area banking sector. Our modelling choice is important because failing to control for unobserved bank heterogeneity and to distinguish between persistent and time-varying inefficiency is likely to yield distorted and biased inefficiency estimates (Colombi et al. 2014; Kumbhakar et al. 2014; Badunenko and Kumbhakar 2017). And third, we test for the impact of the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis on total costs. We employ stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), the most widely used parametric method for measuring firm-specific cost-efficiency. The sample is based on a panel of commercial, cooperative and savings banks from 17 euro area countries over the period from 2006 to 2017. We estimate a trans-log cost function to capture banks’ relative ability to convert inputs (financial capital, labour and other aggregate inputs) into outputs (loans and investments), while minimising costs. The methodology is appealing because it allows the estimation of overall cost-efficiency, technological progress and the equity and scale effects within the same econometric framework. We find that total factor productivity growth (TFPG) in the euro area banking sector decreased from around 2.6% in 2007 to below 1.7% in 2017. The largest component of TFPG (in terms of absolute size) is technological progress. The contribution of this component increased during the last ten years, from 3% in 2007 to 3.4% in 2017. Technical efficiency change is the second-largest component and the main culprit for the decline observed in TFPG over the last decade. For the median bank, the negative contribution of technical efficiency change increased from −0.8% in 2006 to −1.9% in 2017. The scale and equity effect have a minor impact on TFPG. All in all, the decline observed in TFPG in the euro area banking sector is undesirable given the need to enhance the profitability of euro area banks. Looking at the components of Total Factor Productivity, we find that overall cost efficiency for the median euro area bank amounted to around 84% on average over the period from 2006 to 2017, implying that a bank operating on the frontier could produce the same level of output with 84% of the current costs. Moreover, we find that the largest part of bank inefficiency is persistent, suggesting that structural long-term factors (such as location, client structure, macroeconomic environment, regulation, etc.) play a bigger role than time-varying factors. We also find that the shadow cost of equity computed from our model delivers comparable results to those derived from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and point to the fact that the reward for being a better-capitalised institution increased in times of financial stress. Turning to economies of scale, we find that they tend to be larger for smaller institutions, although the largest institutions also exhibit economies of scale. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review, with a focus on studies for European countries. Section 3 decomposes TFPG into its main components. The econometric model disentangling persistent and time-varying inefficiency in the euro area banking sector is presented in Section 4. The data are presented in Section 5 and the econometric results in Section 6. In Section 7, we present empirical results for the various components of TFPG, namely technical efficiency, technological progress and the equity and the scale effect. Section 8 concludes.",
58.0,1.0,Journal of Productivity Analysis,19 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11123-022-00639-y,Model uncertainty and efficiency measurement in stochastic frontier analysis with generalized errors,August 2022,Kamil Makieła,Błażej Mazur,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The main goal of Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) is to estimate (in)efficiencies of decision-making units using a stochastic model of a frontier delimited by ideal, fully efficient units; see Kumbhakar et al. (2020a, b) for an overview. In order to achieve this, the usual (two-sided) observation error is augmented with an additional, one-sided component, representing some form of inefficiency. Nonparametric SFA alternatives that rely on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA; Charnes et al. 1978) and its derivatives have been criticized for ignoring the observation error. Since they are fundamentally non-stochastic, it is problematic, e.g., to assess parameter or model uncertainty or conduct any kind of formal statistical testing. Some of these issues have been addressed in a number of ways; e.g., Simar and Wilson (2015) use nonparametric methods in DEA-like approaches, while Tsionas (2020) demonstrates a Bayesian interpretation of DEA. A particularly appealing approach is represented by Andor et al. (2019), which strives to combine results from various DEA and SFA methods (see also Parmeter and Zelenyuk 2019; Tsionas 2021). Our key contribution is two-fold. First, we formulate a parametric SFA framework that offers a considerable generalization in terms of distributional assumptions, compared to existing alternatives. Second, we demonstrate the applicability of exact and approximate inference techniques, including those for model selection or averaging, which is nontrivial for non-Gaussian models with latent variables. Consequently, we make the generalized formulation manageable for empirical work, avoid potential overparameterization issues, and account for parameter and specification uncertainty. Our results are, in a way, parallel to developments in nonparametric inefficiency analysis, considering nonparametric specification of the error terms, especially the inefficiency-related ones (e.g., Assaf et al. 2021; Florens et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2015; Griffin and Steel 2004). We show that a similar flexibility gain can be achieved fully parametrically by a generalization of distributional assumptions for the symmetric observation error and the inefficiency term. The parametric approach offers direct control over model properties like monotonicity or tail thickness. Moreover, it is possible to obtain (explicit) mixture distributions reflecting model averaging. Assaf et al. (2021) list three SFA-related research gaps, i.e., (i) endogeneity, (ii) functional form specification and (iii) distributional assumptions in the error terms. Our aim is to fill some of these gaps within the parametric approach. Leaving the endogeneity issues aside, we believe that (ii) and (iii), which relate to model specification uncertainty, can be dealt with using model comparison and model averaging over a sufficiently broad model class. Consequently, we first develop a very flexible stochastic frontier (SF) model labeled GT-GB2, which is based on generalized t and generalized beta of the second kind (GB2) distributions (see Harvey and Lange 2017). Second, we make use of model averaging techniques, including Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which is a general tool for inference pooling. There are two ways for using model comparison techniques in order to address specification uncertainty issues: model averaging and model selection. Model selection amounts to assuming a “point estimate” in model space. Selection can be practically equivalent to averaging if one model is clearly superior to others or if all specifications imply very similar empirical conclusions. Otherwise, model averaging seems to be a preferred technique. However, model selection based on empirical criteria is clearly better than arbitrary model choice, which is not rare in practical applications of SFA. We use BMA as our benchmark for model averaging due to its sound theoretical background. Although BMA is predominantly applied to covariate selection problems (Steel 2020), its applicability is not limited to such cases. We focus on averaging over competing stochastic assumptions. However, a simpler option of model selection is obviously available. The methodology presented here also allows for averaging or selection over a broad class of frontier functional form specifications, though we do not pursue this avenue. Our model is also formulated in terms of a nonlinear parametric frontier. Hence, though we estimate (log)linear frontiers in the empirical part of the paper, we make no particular use of the linearity assumption. It is also possible to generalize our framework towards, e.g., a semiparametric frontier formulation. Finally, although we demonstrate results from a basic generalized SF model, we indicate that it can be extended towards panel data framework, varying efficiency distribution, or zero-inefficiency cases (Kumbhakar et al. 2013). The Bayesian approach has made its way into SFA since it allows for inference on latent variables (inefficiencies) and parameters while accounting for the estimation uncertainty. Early works on Bayesian SFA have also addressed the issue of specification uncertainty to some extent; see van den Broeck et al. (1994). Although Bayesian SF models have gained popularity due to fast and reliable numerical methods, e.g., Gibbs sampling, these numerical methods impose limitations on model comparison, which leaves the issue of model uncertainty unresolved in most practical applications. Our approach to estimation is somewhat different since it relies on the direct numerical approximation of the integrated likelihood function. Hence, our framework can be used by both Bayesian and non-Bayesian researchers. We find it particularly attractive because it avoids serious limitations about the error term distribution, frontier functional form, or prior class, which are implied by the broadly used Gibbs sampling-driven Bayesian SF models. We emphasize that our generalization involves broader distributional assumptions and extends the scope of admissible priors or functional forms. The generalization comes at a considerable cost in terms of computation effort. However, our approach is parallelization-friendly, and thus it is in line with the recent hardware and software evolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate not only exact, computationally demanding methods, but also outline simplified, approximate strategies that are likely to be more practical while maintaining essential advantages of exact methods to a satisfactory degree. As far as model averaging and comparison are concerned, we overcome three important barriers, which exist in the abovementioned Bayesian SFA. First, due to the availability of the integrated likelihood, it is possible to effectively use, e.g., Laplace-type approximations in order to compute marginal data density (and Bayes Factors). These quantities are crucial for model comparison, and their estimation is nontrivial in existing SF models. Second, as our approach provides a general parametric class and allows for unrestricted choice of priors, the so-called coherent priors can be used for comparison of nested cases avoiding distortions induced by inherently contradictory prior beliefs, see Makieła and Mazur (2020). Third, the unrestricted choice of priors allows for Bayesian sensitivity analysis. The competing Gibbs sampling-based models used in Bayesian SFA restrict priors to certain parametric classes, so sensitivity checks are feasible only within such classes. Our approach extends the available model space and allows for broad use of model selection or averaging, which in turn allows model uncertainty to be fully addressed. The general and flexible model, GT-GB2, may raise concerns regarding its potential overparameterization. Hence, we emphasize its use as a vehicle for model comparison or specification search. In other words, we avoid the overparameterization issue by using model averaging or selection techniques over a set of nested or limiting special cases. The same is true about potential problems associated with identification of parameters. Our general model is in principle identified. However, in the case of weak sample information, the difference between the prior and posterior information might be limited (the likelihood function might be almost flat in certain directions). Such members of our model class should be ruled out by model selection criteria or down-weighted by averaging procedures. This is in line with our empirical and simulation-based results presented in the paper. To sum up, existing methods in parametric SFA may implicitly introduce strong, possibly irrelevant assumptions without sufficient empirical verification. Consequences, such as distorted inference about structural properties of the analyzed processes or spurious detection of non-existing phenomena (e.g., spurious inefficiency), are therefore likely to happen. Thus, the goal is twofold: (i) to develop a sufficiently general SFA framework, and (ii) to use formal model averaging (or selection) techniques to deal with model specification uncertainty. We obtain density estimates of efficiency scores (for managerial or regulatory decision-making) that adequately reflect the uncertainty about parameters and model specification. The paper is structured as follows. Section ”Existing SFA specifications: an overview of distributional assumptions” provides an overview of the existing SFA literature with respect to distributional assumptions. Section “Formulation of the GT-GB2 model” presents the main assumptions, outlines the model, its nested or limiting cases and possible extensions. Section “Inference: likelihood-based methods for the GT-GB2 model” describes the statistical methods. Finally, Section “Simulations” provides simulation-based evidence in favor of the new SFA framework and Section ”Empirical applications” presents two empirical applications using well-researched datasets, which demonstrate the empirical feasibility of the proposed methods. Section “Conclusions” concludes with a discussion.",1

This need might arise for purposes of performance monitoring, i.e., measuring the extent to which the performance of DMUs complies with overall behavioral or organizational objectives (monetary and non-monetary), as well as for performance control and future planning, namely designing mechanisms that redirect DMUs towards the achievement of managerial goals or normative performance standards. Preferences in DEA studies are often elicited by means commonly used in Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP), namely by incorporating expert information on the desirable input and output values for the evaluated DMUs (Korhonen et al. 2002). One form this might take is that of the Most Preferred Solution (MPS). The MPS is a non-dominated (i.e., strongly DEA-efficient) DMU or a combination of DMUs, which has the most desirable structure in DM’s view, in the sense of maximizing his/her value (Korhonen 2002) or utility function (Yang et al. 2009). It may represent the structure according to which management in a firm wishes to reorganize its branches or it might be viewed as a mentor from which other DMUs can learn. The MPS was incorporated into DEA by Halme et al. (1999), in an approach coined Value Efficiency Analysis (VEA). In VEA, the DMUs are assessed against a frontier consisting of the extended DEA efficient facets intercepting at the MPS, which is chosen by the DM in a prior step. In essence, the marginal rates of substitution (MRSs) of inputs or transformation (MRTs) of outputs imposed on the evaluated DMUs are those observed on the DEA frontier for the MPS. Choosing the MPS is an important issue in VEA, as it affects the resulting efficiency frontier and, consequently, the DMUs’ efficiency scores (Korhonen et al. 2001). A suitably chosen MPS can yield valuable insights regarding the extent to which current DMUs’ performance complies with managerial preferences or organizational goals, and provide the basis for a cost-saving or revenue-increasing restructuring. On the other hand, an inappropriate MPS choice might provide questionable efficiency scores, which may subsequently give rise to poor managerial decisions, such as an unnecessary and costly resource reallocation. Nevertheless, there seems to be no general rule for choosing the MPS in VEA. Instead, several suggestions have been made up to date. In many of these, the MPS is not chosen on the basis of some overall managerial objective and thus it is difficult to come up with an intuitive explanation for the DM’s choice, while in others the chosen MPS may favor specialization in the production of a few outputs or in the use of a few inputs, which is often deemed unsatisfactory by managers (Epstein and Henderson 1989). Other MPS choices may compare DMUs with exceptionally performing benchmarks, assess them against a DMU operating with non-technically optimal scale, or zero and undefined values for MRSs and MRTs, i.e., using vectors of input/output weights including zero values. In addition, no empirical work has been done so far on how alternatively chosen MPSs may affect the VEA efficiency scores. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, to expand the set of MPS choices. We first advocate that the DM could make a more informed choice of the MPS among the efficient DMUs, by paying attention on their position on the efficient frontier. In particular, we propose that prior to MPS choice the efficient DMUs are clustered based on whether they appear in the reference sets of other DMUs in DEA and whether they reside in frontier edges (Edvardsen et al. 2008). This clustering can provide additional information to the DM about the DMUs for which there is strong evidence of good relative performance, those that are potentially overspecialized, and those that may be associated with zero and/or undefined marginal rates. Alternatively, one may choose the MPS among those with Most Productive Scale Size (MPSS), i.e., those achieving maximal average productivity for their input/output bundle. This will ensure that the DMUs are assessed against a technically optimal scale, the achievement of which is a long-term organizational goal, which interests both individual DMUs as well as central management (Førsund and Hjalmarsson 1979). Our third proposed MPS is the combination of peers of the Average Production Unit (APU). The APU is an artificial DMU that operates with the group means quantities of inputs and outputs, and its technical efficiency score reflects the structural efficiency of the whole group of DMUs when resource allocation is centrally coordinated. Its structure reflects the one that each DMU should have in order for the group as a whole to realize its full potential output production, and the resulting VEA scores may be particularly useful for guiding future performance planning. Another proposal is to assess DMUs using on a common vector of strictly positive input/output weights in VEA, by choosing a combination of DMUs that generate a unique Fully Dimensional Efficient Facet (FDEF) as the MPS. This results in evaluating all DMUs against a common standard and well-defined MRSs and MRTs and could be useful in several cases where the assessed DMUs perform essentially the same task or have limited autonomy in setting their own priorities and objectives (i.e., choose individually the values of input/output weights). The paper’s second objective is to provide comparative empirical evidence on how alternative MPS choices may affect the estimated VEA efficiency scores. More specifically, using data for 526 Greek cotton farms, we compare the efficiency estimates obtained by the DEA model and those of VEA models with alternative MPS choices. The results of this analysis provide useful insights regarding the MPS choices that are more likely to result in excessive or negligible differences between the DEA and the VEA distributions of efficiency scores. The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: In the second section, we present the VEA model while in the third section, we review the MPSs proposed previously in VEA and suggest four new. In the fourth and the fifth section, we illustrate how the choice of the MPS may affect VEA efficiency scores. Concluding remarks follow in the last section.",1

(1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977), stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) has been a common approach to gain deeper insights into the potential for productivity improvement (Kumbhakar et al. 2020) and cost reduction in monopolized markets (Bogetoft and Otto 2011). For unit inefficiency, the standard estimation approach was developed by Jondrow et al. (1982), acronymed “JLMS” in the SFA literature. The JLMS estimator is based on the mean (and the mode) of the inefficiency conditioned on the composite error (for later studies of JLMS estimators, see Kumbhakar and Lovell 2000, and Battese and Coelli 1988). Despite its widespread use, the JLMS estimator has been criticized. Wang and Schmidt (2009) show that it shrinks the inefficiency towards its mean, leading to a distribution that is different from the distribution of the inefficiency. The mean and mode are not fully representative characteristics of the conditional distribution of the inefficiency, especially if each unit is observed once. Thus, in cross-sectional context, conditional estimator produces an inconsistent estimator of the inefficiency. Moreover, a conditional estimator is conditioned on an estimated composite error rather than on the composite error itself (Horrace 2005 and Kumbhakar et al. 2015). Therefore, the sampling distribution of the conditional estimator is different from the theoretically assumed conditional distribution of the inefficiency. Consequently, the inefficiencies are inaccurately estimated, something regulatory agencies have stated as an impediment for the practical use of SFA (Badunenko et al. 2012; Stone 2002 and Tsionas 2017). This is also illustrated in a simulation study by Andor et al. (2019), where they show that both the SFA and Data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods used by regulators underestimate the true efficiency values. One way to reduce this problem is to combine the SFA and the DEA (Andor et al. 2019 and Tsionas 2021), but such combinatory approaches are not able to eliminate the underestimation problem. Our approach is similar to the combinatory approach in that it can be viewed as a weighted average of unit inefficiency estimators, but in contrast, it is a weighted average of the sample (industry), solely based on the SFA approach. The proposed regularized estimators can be used as stand-alone estimators along with any other estimators in a combinatory approach. In addition, the regularized estimators described here can be used in a variety of situations but in this paper, we limit ourselves to studying unit inefficiency estimation in a cross-sectional context, using the classical stochastic frontier model suggested by Aigner et al. (1977). We propose a regularized (constrained) estimator based on Bayesian risk (expected loss) that restricts the inefficiencies to satisfy some underlying theoretical (and/or intuitive) conditions. Restrictions on the moments are common options for the imposed constraints upon the likelihood functions (e.g., Hall and Presnell 1999). Our regularized estimators are easily calculated, e.g., they can be the JLMS (unregularized) estimators, with imposed constraints on the first and the second moments of the conditional distribution of the inefficiency. The proposed methodology is different from other recent contributions in the field. For example, Kumbhakar et al. (1991) suggest a single step procedure for the estimation of unit inefficiency when they deploy firm-specific determinants of the inefficiency in the maximum likelihood estimation of the SFA model. They show that ignoring the determinants would lead to biased and inconsistent estimators. However, firm-specific determinants are often unobserved, and even unknown. Another recent contribution is the use of non-parametric and semi-parametric estimation methods, in which the JLMS estimator is used for estimating unit inefficiency (Kumbhakar et al. 2007). Another avenue of research is the use of quantile regression into the estimation of the production function (Bernini et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2014 and Behr 2010). However, this approach introduces a new challenge, specifically that one needs to pay more attention to the selection of appropriate quantiles which can be different for distinct densities of the composite error (Jradi et al. 2019). In addition, no sound and clear post-estimation method for estimating unit inefficiency exists when using quantile regression (Kumbhakar et al. 2020). Under mild assumptions, e.g., log-concavity of the distribution, which covers many of the distributions used in the SFA literature, we analytically investigate some properties of the conditional mode (maximum a posteriori probability estimator) and give a general formula for the conditional mode (and its functions) that can be used with any inefficiency density. Next, we derive a regularized conditional mode estimator with the three most commonly used inefficiency densities, i.e., the half-normal, truncated normal and exponential distributions. The proposed unit inefficiency estimation is considered a restricted or penalized estimation method that improves the estimation of unit inefficiency based on the conditional mean/mode. Therefore, the regularized estimators can be easily derived wherever the JLMS (unregularized) estimators are used. Therefore, the idea of our manuscript can be easily used in any context where the unit inefficiency estimation is calculated based on the optimization of an objective function, by imposing some restrictions to improve the accuracy of the unit inefficiency estimator. An extensive simulation study is conducted, with varying factors, such as the sample size, inefficiency density and signal-to-noise ratio (relative variation of the inefficiency to the variation of random shocks). The simulation results show that the regularized estimators outperform the conventional (unregularized) estimators when the inefficiencies are greater than their mean/mode, especially with a larger signal-to-noise ratio. As the unregularized conditional mean/mode shrinks towards the mean/mode, the regularized conditional mean/mode shrinks less towards the mean/mode, especially for larger inefficiencies. We apply both unregularized and regularized estimators to data from the Swedish electricity distribution sector. The results show that the estimated inefficiencies from the two regularized and unregularized estimators are substantially different, particularly for firms that are in the right tail of the inefficiency distribution. Considering the results from the simulations which are supported analytically (Theorem 3), we recommend that regulators use the results from the regularized estimators for the firms that are ranked highly inefficient, based on their estimated inefficiency scores using the conditional mean/mode. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we derive a general formula for the conditional mode of the inefficiency and analytically investigate some of its properties under mild distributional assumptions of unconditional inefficiency. Next, the regularized estimator is discussed and formally derived for both production and cost functions. It is analytically shown that the regularized conditional mode estimators serve to reduce the shrinkage towards the mode. Regularized conditional mode estimators are presented under three different distributional assumptions. In Section 4, both regularized and unregularized estimators are evaluated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. In Section 5, we present an application based on real data. The data represent electricity distribution firms in Sweden, and we estimate the cost inefficiency, which is used by the Energy Markets Inspectorate as an input in their revenue cap regulation. Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses avenues for future research.",2

Although the measures of inefficiency (at least in the sense of Jondrow et al. 1982) seem to be robust to the distribution of the inefficiency (e.g. Ondrich and Ruggiero 2001), there is no evidence about their robustness to the parametric specification of the determinants of inefficiency. Concerns for the impact of the specification of the efficient frontier and the inefficiency has led to attempts to specify these non-parametrically. Important contributions include Fan et al. (1996), Kumbhakar (2007) and Simar et al. (2017) for the efficient frontier and Tran and Tsionas (2009) and Parmeter et al. (2017) for the determinants of inefficiency. However, fully non-parametric estimators of the frontier and/or the inefficiency have slow rates of convergence. Even in the case where the number of explanatory variables is as small as 4, the computational costs may be very high in any real-world application - especially when the smoothing parameter is selected for each dimension using cross-validation criteria. This paper builds on these previous attempts to relax the parametric assumptions traditionally used in specifying the inefficiency of a stochastic frontier model and proposes an alternative semi-parametric approach which imposes weaker assumptions on the inefficiency. Although not as general as the fully non-parametric methodology suggested by Tran and Tsionas (2009) and Parmeter et al. (2017), the approach does not incur the curse of dimensionality. Instead, it leads to a fast and accurate estimator of the inefficiency even when the number of explanatory variables is large. The proposed semi-parametric approach relies on writing the inefficiency as a single-index with unknown link function. By so doing, the linear stochastic frontier model becomes equivalent to a partially linear single index model for which an extensive literature exists (e.g. among others Carroll et al. 1997; Yu and Ruppert 2002; Xia and Härdle 2006; Lian et al. 2015). The paper provides an identification condition which is more natural for a stochastic frontier model than those used in the literature on partially linear single index models (e.g. Xia et al. 1999; Lin and Kulasekera 2007; Dong et al. 2016; Lian et al. 2015), and proposes an estimation procedure based on penalized cubic splines which can be easily implemented with existing statistical software. This offers practitioners the possibility to easily apply this methodology. We illustrate the approach by analyzing an application of stochastic frontier models to energy demand for US states. A standard assumption used for identification in the literature on partially linear single index model requires the orthogonality of the parameters of the linear and the single index parts. This paper suggests a new test for this assumption implemented through a bootstrap procedure. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the model. The third section proposes a methodology to estimate it. Its asymptotic properties are discussed in the fourth section. A Monte Carlo simulation comparing the new method with standard maximum likelihood procedures is presented in the fifth section. The sixth section illustrates an empirical application to the rebound effect for the US states energy demand.",

According to the World Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA (2019)), oil markets and geopolitical tensions, carbon emissions and climate targets, lack of access electricity for a still important part of the global population (estimated at 850 million people) and the progressive growth of the world population, characterise the world energy sector. Despite the growth in low-emission energy production, the Middle East still represents the region that supplies the largest share of oil on whose imports some important economies depend, especially those of the EU and some Asian countries. Besides, many EU countries largely depend on Russia for the supply of natural gas, and recent events related to the war in Ukraine have dramatically highlighted the need to reduce this dependence in a short time. In addition, the growth in energy demand from developed and emerging countries have led to a progressive depletion of easily accessible fossil energy sources and, combined with the progressive increase in waste produced in rich countries, to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions (especially CO2). For this reason, the Kyoto Protocol has imposed limits on industrialised countries in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and many countries have adopted measures aimed at reducing the energy dependence on fossil sources. Indeed, ensuring the access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all is goal 7 of the UN (2018) sustainable development goals. Energy produced from renewable sources is undoubtedly a solution contributing to reduce these concerns. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2018, 13.5% of the energy produced globally came from renewable energy sources, which include hydroelectricity, biofuels, renewable municipal waste, solar photovoltaic and thermal, wind, geothermal and tide. From 1990 to 2018, renewable energy sources have grown on average by 2.0% per year (IEA (2020a)). In 2018, in the EU countries, the share of energy consumption from renewable sources was 18% of the total, 17.8% in Italy (GSE (2020)). For 2030, the Italian Integrated National Plan for Energy and Climate (MISE et al. (2019)), sets out a share of renewable energy on total consumption of 30%. According to the Agenzia Nazionale Efficienza Energetica (ENEA), the Italian agri-food system is energy-intensive and in 2016 it ranks fourth after mechanics, steel and chemistry in the ranking of sectors with the highest energy consumption (ENEA (2018), page 41). It absorbs 11.3% of the total consumption of electricity and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and 7.8% of diesel, with a preponderant weight of agriculture compared to agro-industry. Consequently, it is an area where significant improvements are possible, both in the consumption patterns and in the contribution to the production of energy from renewable sources. The research question of this paper is to investigate if farms producing renewable energy as related agricultural activity obtain a higher economic outcome/performance with respect to farms not producing RE. This issue is relevant, since a higher economic outcome could convince more farmers to introduce the production of renewable energy, thus contributing to the energy security goal and to the reduction of CO2 emissions, as well as to the reduction of the Italian dependence on imports. Moreover, we compare the economic performance obtained by farms producing renewable energy from different sources, identifying the energy production sources that better reward the fundamental productive factors, i.e. land and labour. To our knowledge, such a comparison is less explored in the literature and represents a relevant contribution. Note that the results of the analysis can be useful in order to boost the energy production by the agricultural sector, so that this sector can effectively help to meet the EU energy targets. To answer the question, we analyse the Italian farms belonging to the FADN network in 2018, taken as a representative year, and compare the companies not producing energy from renewable sources with those that produce it. The differences in structural terms, in terms of the type of farming, geographic areas, economic dimension, as well as of the type of renewable energy produced, are studied. The productivity and the remuneration to the fixed factors of land and labour are then examined and discussed in detail. The results represent a tool that can be useful at the macro level for policy makers, and at the micro level for companies, mainly in energy importing countries, such as Italy and several other European countries. For these countries the recent explosive increases in the price of fossil fuels, specifically oil and natural gas, are fueling inflation, thus eroding the spending power of citizens, already reduced by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and slowing the ongoing economic growth. On the other hand, the strong increase in the price of energy will likely advantage the producers of renewable energies (IEA (2020b); for additional remarks see IEA (2021), Wang et al. (2014) and Fernandez-Perez et al. (2016)). The paper is organised as follow. Section Background briefly presents the background of renewable energies in agriculture, in the EU and in Italy. In Section Data and methodology we present the methodologies used: statistical comparisons, the computation of economic ratios and multivariate regression models. Section Statistical analysis reports the data used, and Section Economic analysis describes the sample and the statistical analysis carried out. Section Multivariate regression analysis reports and discusses the results of the economic analysis performed, focused on an analysis of productivity and remuneration to the fixed factors. Section Conclusions discusses the results of the multivariate regression analysis carried out. Finally, Section Conclusions presents the main conclusions of the study and some policy implications.",

It includes an article on “Performance measurement and joint production of intended and unintended outputs” by Førsund (2021a), three comments on this article by Färe and Grosskopf (2021), Murty and Russell (2021), and Ang and Dakpo (2021) as well as rejoinders to the comments by Førsund (2021b). The special issue is anticipated to be the first of an irregular series on symposia sponsored by the journal. In their overview, the editors state: “The intent of the series is to give leading scholars in the productivity and efficiency community the chance to exchange ideas on topics that have proven both controversial and of particular interest to the community” (Greene et al. 2021). To complement the exchange of ideas in the first special issue, I would like to share insights and experiences from several decades of research and teaching in sustainable industrial production and controlling by commenting on the topic in general and the statements of the five papers in particular. I hope that this will shed better light on some facts and help to further clarify some controversies. The following statements summarise several (differently important) conclusions of my paper: In general, material and energy balances are not explicated in production models. How to systematically decide which types of inputs and outputs should be taken account of and distinguished seems to be an open question that has not yet been satisfactorily answered by the productivity and efficiency literature. Quite a few industries are characterised by unintended outputs (by-products) which may nevertheless be desirable. On the contrary, even intended outputs (main products) – i.e., outputs where the process is established or perpetuated by the purpose of obtaining certain quantities of them – can be undesirable if they are produced in abundance, in which case their excess quantities are superfluous or waste. Reality shows that multi-output production exists in various manifestations, which are often not clearly defined and delineated in the literature, leading to misunderstandings. This is especially true for different types of joint production. In order to capture the important phenomena that are the main cause for producing undesirable outputs, the notion of ‘coupled production’ is proposed here. A coupled output is defined as an output – and a co-product in particular as a main product – that is taken account of and unavoidably emerges with a main product and is of a different type (otherwise, it would be an excess quantity).Footnote 1 A production system is characterised by coupled production if at least one type of coupled output or co-product is considered (to be relevant). The purpose of a system that transforms inputs into outputs may also be to eliminate a particular type of undesirable objects (bads). They form the intended input of so-called reduction processes that reduce, convert, abort, or destroy this input, such as the treatment of wastewater and incineration of solid waste or the dismantling of end-of-life vehicles, old buildings, and nuclear power plants. Reduction processes inevitably generate new kinds of different outputs (which are often themselves more or less undesirable), so that they are strongly coupled with the elimination of the bad. To measure the relative performance of production or reduction activities of decision-making units (DMUs) with non-parametric methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA), it is not necessary to know the properties of the actual entire real technology in this respect. One only needs to know the feasibility and (validity of the) properties of the efficient ‘best practice’ frontier determined by the envelopment of the measured data points via the chosen method. These statements will now be explained and extended, referring to the topic and papers of the special issue. Section 2 discusses general aspects of proper modelling of production systems with unintended or undesirable outputs, and Section 3 specifically respective models for industrial processes. Both sections focus in particular on performance measurement by DEA. Section 4 concludes with comments on future research perspectives.",1

59.0,2.0,Journal of Productivity Analysis,13 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11123-023-00663-6,Trade for catch-up: examining how global value chains participation affects productive efficiency,April 2023,Gideon Ndubuisi,Solomon Owusu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most prominent aspects of the current wave of globalization is the fragmentation of production stages into different tasks that are performed sequentially across multiple national borders. This phenomenon, which is now popularly known as the global value chain (GVC), has offered numerous benefits to both developed and developing countries. Extant studies indicate that through GVC participation, countries—or more specifically, firms—are provided with essential opportunities to specialize in core tasks that contribute positively to productivity growth (see Amador and Cabral 2015).Footnote 1 GVC participation also provides countries with opportunities to acquire productive and technological capabilities (Hausman 2014; Pahl and Timmer 2020; Ndubuisi and Owusu 2021; Owusu 2021). Other things equal, these opportunities should trickle down into better productive efficiency and, in turn, contribute to the convergence of countries towards the global productive efficiency frontier. This argument is consistent with erstwhile studies suggesting that productive and technological capabilities are an important determinant of productive efficiency and global productivity convergence (Benhabib and Spiegel 1994; Tzeremes 2014; Danquah and Ouattara 2015; Danquah 2018; Das and Drine 2020; Ndubuisi et al. 2022). GVC can, therefore, be considered a strong predictor of productive efficiency and convergence. For instance, both knowledge spillovers and outright technology transfer through GVC favor a parsimonious accumulation of productive and technological capabilities that engender a more efficient technique of production across borders. A similar benefit emanates from both the disciplinary competition effects and the specialization in core competencies associated with GVC. Baldwin (2016) hints at this in his book, noting that the unbundling of GVC has led to the “great convergence”. He alludes further that GVC has led a selected number of emerging economies to industrialize and enlarge the scale of manufacturing activities to kickstart their convergence journey, sometimes converging to the income levels of advanced economies. A similar view underscores the recent endorsement of GVC by development agencies and international organizations as an easier route to unlock the long-awaited economic transformation of developing countries (e.g., UNIDO 2018; World Bank 2020; Abreha et al. 2021). Despite these, the GVC literature is yet to empirically examine the productive efficiency and convergence effects of GVC. At best, existing studies have predominantly focused on GVC’s effect on income per capita or productivity growth (Criscuolo and Timmis 2017; Constantinescu et al. 2019; Ignatenko et al. 2019; Pahl and Timmer 2020; Owusu 2021; Jangam and Rath 2021). Furthermore, these studies have to a greater extent proceeded with an implicit assumption that the income per capita or productivity gains from GVC are automatic. This is evident by their predominant neglect of country idiosyncrasies that act as enablers or inhibitors of productivity gains from GVC. However, a long-standing view in the literature is that gains from GVC are not automatic and depend on a host of other factors such as firm, industry, and country characteristics (Morrison et al. 2008; Sampath and Vallejo 2018; Amendolagine et al. 2019; Mazzi et al. 2020; Ndubusi and Owusu 2021). Admittedly, two important exceptions to the literature on the productivity growth effects of GVC are Pahl and Timmer (2020) and Owusu (2021). In addition to examining the linear relation between GVC and productivity growth, these papers examine how this relationship is influenced by a country’s natural resource endowment. Against this backdrop, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, we deviate from the predominant focus on income per capita or productivity growth and examine the effect of GVC participation on productive efficiency—defined herewith as a country’s relative productive efficiency to the global productive efficiency frontier. Hence, our study does not just capture how GVC participation enables a country to become productively efficient, but how it expedites the country’s catch-up process to the global efficiency frontier. The importance of operating at the global efficiency frontier cannot be overemphasized. Among others, countries that are able to operate at the global efficiency frontier compete effectively in the global market, increase their market reach by targeting high-growth markets, increase the complexity of their export bucket, and increase the incomes and welfare of citizens (Yang et al. 2021). Hence, understanding the factors that drive productive efficiency as per bridging a country’s productive efficiency gap to that of the global frontier is of utmost policy importance. In the second objective of this paper, and inspired by the view that the gains from GVC are not automatic, we investigate how a country’s macroeconomic conditions shape the nature of the relationship between GVC and productive efficiency. For this we focus on the role of human capital, macroeconomic distortions, financial development, and the country’s position in value chains—a contribution as far more expansive than Pahl and Timmer (2020) and Owusu (2021). To address our research objectives, we use country-level data across 126 developed and developing countries for the period 2000–2016. Countries can participate in GVC through backward and/or forward linkages. Hence, we follow recent developments in the GVC literature that measures the extent of GVC participation as the sum of the share of foreign value-added used in a country’s exports (we call this backward GVC participation) and the share of a country’s domestic value‐added that enters as an intermediate input in the value‐added exported by other countries (we call this forward GVC participation) (see Amendolagine et al. 2019; Carril‐Caccia and Pavlova 2020; Ndubuisi and Owusu 2021). Our empirical approach is a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, we use a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to compute a measure of productive efficiency. The DEA method is a non-parametric linear programming method that has become a workhorse tool to examine differences in productive performance and efficiency. In this regard, one of its goals is to distinguish countries that are on the global production frontier from lagging countries (Enflo and Hjertstrand 2009). Originally used for efficiency analysis at the micro-level, DEA has gained prominence as a non-parametric approach to studying productive performance and convergence at the meso and macro-level. As a non-parametric method, DEA provides several advantages over alternative approaches to studying productive performance and convergence. For instance, unlike the growth accounting and the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach, it neither requires any functional form specification nor assumption about market structure and optimization behavior (Margaritis et al. 2007; Enflo and Hjertstrand 2009). The DEA method also has the advantage that it endogenously computes a virtual frontier. It uses this to derive country-specific indicators, thus capturing the distance of each country to the virtual frontier that can then be used in a reduced-form equation. This negates making any assumption that leads to defining a country (or countries) as operative at the frontier. It also leads to an index that can be used in a reduced-form equation, providing a more flexible framework to track country characteristics that may influence the effect of the explanatory variable of interest (in our case, GVC participation) on the outcome variable. Knitted closely to this advantage, the second stage of our empirical approach involves regressing the productive efficiency index (obtained from the DEA analysis) on indicators of GVC and a host of other country characteristics. In line with our second research objective, we also regress the productive efficiency index on sets of interaction variables comprising GVC participation and the country characteristics of interests as aforementioned. To preview our results, we find that GVC participation has an unambiguously positive effect on productive efficiency—that is, it enables countries to catch-up to the global productive efficiency frontier. We also find that the productive efficiency gains from GVC participation work through backward and forward linkages in GVC. Our analysis of the intermediatory roles of country characteristics reveals that the productive efficiency gains from GVC participation are higher for countries that invest more in human capital have a stable macroeconomic environment and a well-developed and well-functioning financial market. When we consider the role of position along the value chains, we find that both participation and position in GVC matter decisively for improving productive efficiency. However, the productive efficiency gains from GVC participation are higher for countries with downstream specialization—i.e., countries that are closer to the final demand stage. Finally, further analysis of two subsamples comprising developed and developing countries reveals that the productive efficiency gains from GVC are stronger for developing countries. Overall, our results underscore the importance of GVC as a veritable channel of catching-up to the global productive efficiency frontier, especially for technology-lagging countries and countries that invest effectively in human capital stock, maintain stable macroeconomic conditions, have a well-developed financial market, and can specialize in higher value-added downstream activities of the value chains. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section “Literature review” reviews the related literature, further providing theoretical insights underlining the relationships of our study. The research design, including the description of data sources, computation of variables, and descriptive statistics, is presented in Section “Research design“.

At the industrial level, a general definition of productivity relates to the capability of a firm to use and combine input factors for the production of a certain output. This general definition encounters several complications as the reliability of the models and the results become central to the policy decision making processes. The geographic amplitude of the systems, the interactions between competitors, cooperative and public agents, the limitation of resource conditions, and the improvement in production processes and knowledge mechanisms, these are only a limited set of issues that may arise in the investigation of productivity. This improvement in the complexity of empirical investigations accompanies the need for policymakers to understand, develop and sustain the current productivity level of the industries in view of long-term economic growth and per capita income growth. One of the main relevant (and challenging) sectors in the world economic balance for production analysis applications is clearly the tourism sector. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated the contribution of the Travel & Tourism sector as 10.4% of global GDP in 2019, and 5.5% in 2020, with a loss of US$ 4.7 trillion in this last year. In terms of job creation, the WTTC said the sector accounted for one in four of all the new jobs created prior to the pandemic. Italy represents a meaningful case study to analyse tourism productivity, in the first place, because of its impact on total GDP. According to the National Agency for Tourism (hereinafter ENIT), in 2019 the Italian tourism industry accounted for 13% of Italy’s GDP, providing 4,2 million employees (ENIT 2020). The challenge in analysing tourism system productivity can be easily seen starting from the definition of the tourism system itself. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines tourism industriesFootnote 1 as comprising “all establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic activity. Tourism industries (also referred to as tourism activities) are the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic products.” In this way, it seems natural to relate the investigation of tourism productivity to multi behavioural conceptualisation tools (Buhalis 2000; Haugland et al. 2011; Murphy et al. 2000), such as network analysis (Baggio et al. 2010; Dwyer et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2021), in the perspective of co-production and collaboration of different actors for the total destination product. The complexity of the network can be described by three main features: (i) multisectoral and multiproduct production processes (Otto and Ritchie 1996), (ii) spatial phenomena such as agglomeration and clustering (Kim et al. 2021; Li and Liu 2021), and (iii) contextual factors and physical characteristics of the destination identifying specific tourism segments (Yang 2016). Despite the relevance of these three aspects, to our knowledge none of the studies in the literature analysing tourism productivity attempted to match and combine all of them. Considering the first of the three aspects, it is well recognised that tourism is a “multi-sectorial and inseparable sector” (Hor 2021, p.1) that integrates various activities such as travel, accommodations, restaurants, art and entertainment. Indeed, it does not appear as a unique sector nor in the input-output tables nor in national account systems (Fletcher 1989; Teigeiro and Diaz 2014). A fundamental profitable opportunity for the actors in this industry can therefore be represented by a wider access to a heterogeneous set of resources, a higher level of flexibility and responsiveness of the system and a greater openness to new technologies and services. The evolutionary aspect of the multi-sectoral connotation of the tourism industry relates to the increased possibility of new working relationships, learning and innovation practices, knowledge transfer (Baggio and Cooper 2010; Fleming and Marx 2006), and to a greater access to promotion and commercialisation campaigns, complementary assets, and co-joint actions (Ndou and Passiante 2005). Then, the longevity and the strength of the structure of the relationships, or in other words, the social capital (Coleman 1988) of the tourism destinations can turn into a massive channel for value creation, leading to the need of investigating and understanding the linkages that support tourism value creation (Du and Zhao 2013). The second aspect related to the complexity of networks in tourism economic systems is related to spatial phenomena such as agglomeration and clustering (Kim et al. 2021; Li and Liu 2021): along with the identification and investigations of spillover mechanisms and channels between related subjects and the nontrivial investigation of productivity, the awareness that the geographical dimension and the investigation of tourism productive systems is important raises the bar to the development and application of adequate statistical and econometric methods for analysis (Assaf and Dwyer 2013; Joppe and Li 2016; Pham 2020) among which spatial models (Yang and Wong 2012; Kim et al. 2021). In this work, we improve the level of analysis developed in the literature, considering a dynamic spatial panel data model (Elhorst 2013) where sectoral-specific input spillovers are evaluated together with cross-sectoral linkages. Most research on tourism productivity from a regional viewpoint uses linear regressions considering different functional forms, estimation approaches, and variables of interest. However, in line with Kim et al. (2021), the following analyses will reveal the fundamental role of both temporal and spatial components in deepening the relationships characterising the productive process of a tourism system. The starting point of this study is to support the idea that ignoring the dynamics and spatial dependences could offer misleading estimates, depicting the reliability of the results obtained with the adopted methodology over more standard approaches. The third aspect describing the complexity of the tourism system, and representing the main challenge of this work, concerns the strong connection of the tourism industry to the contextual factors and the physical characteristics of the destination (Yang 2016). The relevance of this feature can be easily appreciated for Italy. The country is a clear example of tourism product fragmentation and heterogeneity (Sainaghi and Baggio 2017). These two features of the tourism supply are usually found in countries with economic balances and national accounts that are strongly related to the tourism sector (Haugland et al. 2011; Pearce 1989). Here, the national and regional government policies and business strategies are combined with the capacity of local agents and stakeholders to provide, sustain and implement adequate instruments that adapt to the specificities of the destinations (Whitford 2004) as a diversified portfolio of goods and services for a pluralism of customers with different needs and preferences (Romão et al. 2015). Local communities, stakeholders and public agents play a key role in developing attractive tourism experiences around the physical, cultural and geographical characteristics of the territory (Sainaghi and Mauri 2015). The singularities of the local destinations and of the different processes of collaboration and co-production of tourism-related industries, generate several questions on the possible differences in productivity and spillover effects of destinations belonging to different tourism segments (e.g. cultural and heritage, sport, religious tourism). Thus, motivated by the multiple-purpose nature of the Italian tourism industry, this work aims to provide evidence of substantial differences in spillover mechanisms when differentiating between three important segments of Italian tourism activity: large cities and destinations with a cultural, historical, or artistic offerings (hereinafter identified as cities), maritime destinations (sea), and lake, thermal, mountains and scenic destinations (mountain). In particular, this study does not just look at whether there are spatial interdependencies or dynamic effects in the Italian tourism system as a whole but also investigates the heterogeneity by destination typology. In sum, using aggregated data on the consolidated accounts of different tourism sectors at the local labour systems level for Italy in the period 2011–2020, we investigate the productivity performance of the tourism industry, differentiating between tourism segments, using a spatial econometric approach. In particular, this is the first contribution modelling cross-sectoral and spatial spillover effects together in the Italian tourism industry, further combining two fundamental features for policy decisions: high spatial detail of analysis and the multipurpose nature of tourism destinations. Indeed, the choice of Local Market Areas (hereinafter, LMA) as spatial detail of the analysis merged the importance of considering the destination as a fundamental unit in several economic and managerial branchesFootnote 2, and the idea of capturing economic and socio-cultural aspects and patterns in the tourism production process that couldn’t be observed at regional or national level (Bernini and Guizzardi 2010; Ma et al. 2015; Yang 2016). Then, even if this spatial detail is not unusual for different purposes in the tourism literature (for a review see Lazzeretti et al. 2008), LMAs have never been considered as spatial statistical units in a tourism productivity analysis. The results will offer a new perspective for policymakers guiding them in taking advantage of existing spatial diffusion or competition processes occurring across nearby destinations, and to design appropriate cluster-based developing programs in order to support all segments and sectors of the Italian tourism industry both in the short and in the long run.",

(1998), implies that the (minimum) cost of producing a number of products jointly may not be greater than the sum of (minimum) cost of producing separately mutually exclusive subsets of them. In other words, the cost function is subadditive if it is not less expensive for two or more firms to produce each a subset of a given bundle of products than it is for a single firm to produce the whole array of products. When each firm produces a single output or more generally, when we have the case of mutually orthogonal firm output vectors, cost subadditivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for scope economies (Baumol et al. 1998, p. 71) while when all firms produce some of the products and jointly with them, each one produces a unique subset of the remaining products, cost subadditivity implies economies of diversification (Grosskopf et al. 1992), reflecting cost savings that may result from an increase in the number of simultaneously produced products. Färe (1986) developed a nonparametric test for cost subadditivity using the relation between the dual and the primal representations of the technology. In particular, he showed that if the cost function is subadditive then efficiency measured with respect to the “sum technology” is not less than efficiency measured with respect to the “combined technology”, where the former is defined by the sum of the firm’s input requirement sets and the latter by the input requirement set of the combined firm which is the sum of the firms. The ratio of these two efficiency scores consist Färe’s (1986) gain function, which is not less than one when the cost function is subadditive. The aim of this paper is to re-state Färe (1986) condition for cost subadditivity in terms of aggregative efficiencies. In particular, we show that if the cost function is subadditive then aggregate cost efficiency is not less than the cost efficiency of the average production unit. On the other hand, Maindiratta (1991) considered a non-parametric test, in the spirit of Afriat (1972), Hanoch and Rothschild (1972), Diewert and Parkan (1983), Varian (1984) and Banker and Maindiratta (1988), to examine the consistency of observed production data with cost minimization behavior under a subadditive cost function. This test requires the solution of an integer programming problem for each firm. Using our main result, namely that if the cost function is subadditive then the aggregate cost efficiency is not less than the cost efficiency of the average production unit, one can overcome the need for solving these integer programming problems as we provide an equivalent condition to those stated in Maindiratta (1991) that can directly be used to test whether a technology characterized by a subadditive cost function rationalizes the observe data.",

Stead,Phill Wheat,William H. Greene,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"In recent years, a number of latent class and finite mixture (LCFM) stochastic frontier (SF) models have been proposed. Orea and Kumbhakar (2004), Greene (2005), and Kutlu et al. (2020) propose latent class SF models in which there are J classes of firms with differing technologies, and class membership is unobserved. This is one way of allowing for technological heterogeneity between firms. The zero inefficiency stochastic frontier (ZISF) model proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2013) and Rho and Schmidt (2015), in which an unknown proportion of firms are fully efficient, is also an LCFM model. Our illustrative example for the present study is a SF model in which the noise distribution is contaminated normal—i.e. a scale mixture of normal distributions. The use of LCFM models raises the issue class enumeration, i.e. determining the correct number of classes or mixture components to include in the model. A natural way to do this would be to use the likelihood ratio (LR) statistic to test more complex models against simpler null models with fewer classes or mixture components. However the well-known Wilks (1938) result that the asymptotic distribution of the LR statistic is \(\chi _k^2\) under the null hypothesis, where k is the number of restrictions, does not apply in this context because of identification issues and boundary issues under the null hypothesis. For this reason, a number of alternative approaches to class enumeration—see Nylund et al. (2007) for discussion and comparison—are common, such as the use of information criteria, as in Orea and Kumbhakar (2004), Greene (2005), and Kutlu et al. (2020) in the SF literature. Many information criteria penalise model complexity, though some others such as the complete likelihood classification (CLC) and the integrated classification likelihood (ICL) criterion (McLachlan and Peel 2000) instead penalise poorly separated clusters—see Fonseca and Cardoso (2007) for a discussion. We prefer hypothesis tests over information criteria for two reasons. First, although Kutlu et al. (2020) show that ICs can perform well in identifying the number of classes in an SF setting, Monte Carlo evidence suggests that likelihood-based tests outperform ICs in terms of selecting the number of classes or mixture components (Nylund et al. 2007). Second, we wish to conduct tests where the null hypothesis is interesting in economic or statistical terms. For example, in the LCFM SF model proposed of Orea and Kumbhakar (2004) and Greene (2005), testing against the nested standard SF model can be interpreted as testing the null hypothesis of technological homogeneity. In this paper, we discuss the problem of hypothesis testing in LCFM models in the specific context of SF analysis. Although the problem in general can be very complex, we utilise results from the literature on likelihood-based tests for LCFM models for a class of models, including SF models, to derive results on the asymptotic distribution of a modified likelihood ratio (MLR) statistic under the null hypothesis. It is the non-Gaussian error distribution in the SF setting that allows us to derive these results, results that may not hold in a Gaussian setting. These results have broad applicability to LCFM SF models in general. We explore the applicability of these results, providing some evidence from Monte Carlo simulations. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The section “Latent class and finite mixture stochastic frontier models” reviews the use of LCFM specifications in SF modelling, and issues that arise in hypothesis testing. The section “Hypothesis testing in latent class and finite mixture stochastic frontier models” discusses hypothesis testing in LCFM models generally, focussing on results regarding the asymptotic distribution of the MLR test statistic under the null hypothesis that are relevant to the SF context. The section “Applications” presents some Monte Carlo evidence on the sampling distribution of the MLR statistic and compares this to the asymptotic results found in the literature. The section “Empirical application” provides a brief empirical application of a particular LCFM SF model. The section “Summary and conclusions” concludes.",
