The delivery of such content causes a lot of data transfer in the Internet backbone. ISPs are investing in the network infrastructure, in order to provide a better quality of services for network users, but the ISPs get revenue from end-users or CPs that directly connect to their network. Nowadays, new broadband applications cause huge amount of traffic without generating direct revenues for the ISPs. Hence, the ISPs want to get additional revenues from the CPs creating stress on their network to compensate investment cost. Actually, whether ISPs can charge CPs or not remains the center of the network neutrality debate [5, 11, 23]. This neutrality principle means that ISPs and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication. In this work, we consider an Internet supply chain with CPs, ISPs, and end-users. Though, in practice, we often have ISPs and CPs in competition for customers. The ISP charges end-users based on their usage and sets their quality of service (QoS) level according to the price paid. The CP charges end-users based on their usage and sets their credibility of content level according to the price paid. End-users adapt their demand of content based on the providers’ (CP and ISP) policies. A Stackelberg leader-follower game [12] is a strategic game in which a leader player commits a strategy first and then other followers move sequentially. In this paper, we use a Stackelberg game to analyze how the side payment between CP and ISP is determined. At the first stage of the Stackelberg game, the ISP sets the side payment for the CP. Then in the second stage of the game, the ISPs play a non-cooperative game and the CPs play a non-cooperative game. We solve the Stackelberg game by backward induction [12]. Given the side payment set by the ISP, the non-cooperative game between ISPs and the non-cooperative game between CPs is solved firstly. Then the ISP sets the optimal side payment to charge the CP through backward induction. Game theory [12] is the mathematical study of the behavior of decision-makers (players) whose decisions affect each other. This theory models the interactions between players with conflicting objectives. It has been applied in many fields where the strategies for each player depend on the actions of all players. Nash Equilibrium [21] is one of the fundamental concepts of game theory which describes the equilibrium when each players’ strategy is a best response to all other strategies. Loosely speaking, a Nash equilibrium is a state of game theory where no player can improve its payoff by changing its strategy if the other players maintain their current strategies. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
 We present new features in the mathematical modeling that include CPs revenues and ISPs revenues. We include quality levels, in addition to prices, for both CP and ISP, as they engage in competition for end-users at the demand markets. We model competition between the ISP based on two market parameters, network access price and QoS. Moreover, each ISP wants to maximize its utility. We formulate this competitive problem between ISPs as a non-cooperative game. We model competition between the CPs based on two market parameters, content access price and credibility of content, where all CPs want to maximize their utility. We formulate the competitive problem between CPs as a non-cooperative game. We use the Stackelberg game to analyze how the side payment is determined. We adopt the method backward induction to solve the proposed Stackelberg game. We analytically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the non-cooperative game between ISP and between CPs, which means that there exists a stable state where all providers do not have an incentive to change their strategies. So, our model ensures the existence of an equilibrium for keeping the economy stable and achieving economic growth. The best response algorithm is used to find the Nash equilibrium point. Numerical analysis shows the effect of side payments from CP to ISP and the effect of the cost of bandwidth on providers’(CPs and ISPs) policies. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. In Section 3, we describe the system model, demand model, content credibility and utility functions. In Section 4, we model a Stackelberg game. In Section 5 we formulate a non-cooperative game, and prove the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium solution. Then, we present numerical results in Section 6. Conclusions and future guidelines are drawn in Section 7.",10

Otherwise it would be difficult to explain why the prediction of the use of mobile payments and their actual adoption differ to such an extent (see, for instance, the Oracle White Paper by [14], pp. 9 ff., as well as the PWC Mobile Payment Report 2017 for Germany by [7]).Footnote 1 As documented in the literature review below, in most of the papers, mobile payments are studied, mainly concerning the intention to use or the actual use of these payments by consumers. Nonetheless, there is a bunch of theoretical papers that formalize the use of different payment methods, also recorded below. They are focused on the opportunity cost of different instruments, their transaction cost, on socio-demographic aspects like income and age, as well as network externalities. Obviously, the existing theoretical literature seems too restricted in its approach, whereas the empirical literature did not fully combine the relevant processes into a consistent and coherent model to get the whole picture right. The objective of this paper is to provide some new ideas for a theoretical analysis of mobile payments. The conjecture in this paper is that consumers are the bottleneck of mobile payment adoption, given the current development state of mobile payment systems. Since even the similarity or dissimilarity between cash, card-based methods and mobile payments are neither sufficiently analyzed nor measured, the first addition to the literature of this paper is the suggestion of a measure for the similarity of payment systems: the vector similarity of their salient characteristics from a consumers’ perspective. Based on this measure, the consumers’ demand for the different payment instruments can be formalized, as shown below. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that currently novel mobile payment methods are a technical innovation that competes with well-established, well-known and well-understood cash and card-based payment methods. Put differently, established technologies compete with a technical innovation. It is argued in this paper that novel mobile payment methods and payment systems are incomplete innovations: they lack certain technical features on the merchants’ and the consumers’ side, as well as institutional and regulatory features that are on a comparable level as in the case of cash and card-based systems. Therefore, currently novel mobile payment systems will be called a “Kranzberg-incomplete” technology, according to [32]; in contrast, cash and card-based payment methods and the like are in this paper assumed to be “Kranzberg-complete” technologies.Footnote 2 This is the second addition to the literature of this paper. Moreover, all kinds of payment methods and systems are prone to (direct and indirect) network externalities. To take account of these externalities, institutional and regulatory innovations are necessary to complete the “technical innovation package” [32]. In other words, the break-through of technical innovations depends to a high degree on innovations that are not “technical” in the literal sense of the word. In this paper, the missing institutional and regulatory supplements are discussed; this is its third contribution to the literature. The available economic literature on mobile payments may be differentiated in papers whose concern is (1) the entire business and economic processes of the introduction and adoption of the new technology, (2) the competition for the technical infrastructure of mobile payments and (3) the consumers’ usage decisions. Since this literature has grown rapidly and is still growing rapidly, no complete survey is intended here.Footnote 3 In Section 1.2.4, theoretical research is briefly reviewed. In the first category (1), Au and Kauffman [2] present a comprehensive stakeholder framework for the analysis of economic questions and problems that are connected with the intrusion of disruptive technologies into economies (see Fig. 1, p. 147, in [2]). As decisive stakeholders, they identify technology producers, sellers and business intermediaries, end-users, consumers and buyers, as well as the government and regulators. Moreover, they differentiate the entire business and economic process into four phases, namely the payment technology’s emergence, its diffusion and adoption and its growth ([2], p. 147). These aspects will be taken up in Section 3 of this paper. Kranzberg-(in)completeness meets Lancaster-demand. Legend: MPI Mobile Payment Instrument. - Source: Own depiction The next paper in this category is that of Guo and Bouwman [22]. They study from merchants’ views the adoption of mobile payments in China that were introduced by private companies. In addition, they review research papers that analyze the adoption of mobile payment methods from the merchants’ perspective (Table 1 in [22], p. 149). Furthermore, they depict the merchants’ position in the so-called m-payment ecosystem. This framework is chosen to explain the adoption of mobile payment methods since the development of the respective platforms and stimulating government policies seem not sufficient to explain the adoption process. A qualitative study underpins the complexity of the adoption process in which all tiers of the m-payment ecosystem are involved. The third paper in this category is that of Liébana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio [36]. In this paper, too, the adoption of mobile payment systems is studied from a merchant’s perspective. They find that neural network analysis is the tool to be applied for the prediction of the adoption of mobile payment systems. In category (2), the paper of Pousttchi et al. [44] could be located, as they provide an analytical framework for mobile payment business models. The framework consists of five building blocks: Infrastructure Management (assets, resources, partnerships for value creating via mobile payments), Product (bundle of consumer values of the payment provider), Consumer Interface (targeted consumers, relationship, distribution channel), Financial Perspective (cost, revenues and financing of the business model) and Threat Consideration (threats to the value of the business model; [44], Fig. 1, p. 370). Without going into details, the framework describes the ecosystem of mobile payment providers, with many interconnections, but without a viable model. Whereas in [44] business models are structured, Ozcan and Santos [43] study how firms worldwide try to fix the architecture of the market for mobile payments. The firms or players are financial institutions, mobile operators, hardware and software providers, handset manufacturers and merchants (see Fig. 1, p. 1491 in [43]). The result of Ozcan and Santos is sobering insofar as they conclude that “the market never was”: Since no agreement on the market architecture could be reached, “the” market for mobile payments is still missing. These issues are a topic in Section 4 of this paper. Most available papers on mobile payments are in category (3). The basis of many papers is the UTAUT or UTAUT2 concept of Venkatesh et al., [57, 58]. In these two papers, the authors distilled empirically – led by theoretical conceptions – those factors that are the main drivers of IT acceptance (unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, UTAUT, [57]), as well as IT acceptance and use (UTAUT2, [58]). According to [58], Fig. 1, p. 160, the behavioral intention to use IT is driven by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value and habit. Moderating variables are age, gender and experience. Furthermore, habit and experience play a special role as they have a more direct influence on use behavior, and not only on behavioral intention, [58]. With respect to mobile payments, a comprehensive analysis from the consumers’ viewpoint is presented by Fumiko Hayashi [24]. In a qualitative early study, Mallat [39] emphasizes that the adoption of mobile payments depends on such factors as “lack of other payment methods” and “urgency” ([39], p. 413). Moreover, the identified obstacles to adoption are “… premium pricing, complexity, a lack of critical mass, and perceived risks” ([39], p. 413). In a literature review on the intention to use mobile payments, Kim, Mirusmonov and Lee [30] conclude that besides consumer-specific factors four characteristics of mobile payments are adoption-relevant: “mobility, reachability, compatibility and convenience” ([30], p. 310). This is mainly confirmed by an empirical study of Schierz, Schilke and Wirtz [50]. In an empirical study for China, Yang et al. [60] find that additionally social influences, as well as personalities, play a crucial role; moreover, the behavioral impact of the factors varies between pre-adoption and post-adoption of mobile payments. Lu et al. [38] emphasize the role of trust for the adoption of mobile payments: the trust that consumers developed with internet payment systems can influence the trust in mobile payment systems, among others. In an empirical study with data from Portugal, Oliveira et al. [42] found that “compatibility, perceived technical security, performance expectations, innovativeness and social influence” had significant effects on adoption and recommendation of mobile payments. An investigation of in-store mobile payments in France revealed that privacy and lack of financial risk, as well as convenience, are the main drivers for this kind of payment, in combination with past experience with the method [18]. Qasim and Abu-Shanab [46] conclude from an empirical study in Jordan with teachers, master students and researchers that network externalities were the most important variable to explain mobile payment acceptance, besides performance expectancy, trust and social influence. Arvidsson [1] summarizes the results of an empirical investigation with data from Sweden as follows: The single most important feature stimulating the use of mobile payments is ease of use. However, in addition to that, also the relative advantages of this payment method to others with respect to high trust in services (reliability) and low security risks are relevant. In an empirical study with representative data for U.S. consumers, Schuh and Stavins [51] concluded that the use of payment methods depends on the characteristics of the payment method, by controlling for financial and demographic factors. Ease of use, security and cost determined the use of the payment method. Recently, Schuh and Stavins [52] analyzed with U.S. data from 2013 whether “speed” and “security” do have a significant influence on the adoption of payment instruments in general. The empirical results indicate that consumers’ demand for payments is not at all elastic concerning speed and security. This implies that marginal changes in both characteristics may not have an effect on payment methods. Moreover, avoiding security discontinuity may be a major factor to establish public trust in payment methods whatsoever. Balasubramanian and Drake [4] emphasize the importance of mobile payments for developing countries. They find that service reliability is among the most important characteristics in these countries, as well as agent expertise in a competitive setting. Moreover, pricing transparency is a relevant driver of demand for mobile payments. In a field experiment in Afghanistan, where salaries by a firm were paid via “mobile money” instead of cash, the employer benefitted by significantly lower costs, whereas individual employees seem not to have similarly benefitted with respect to wealth or wellbeing [9]. To round up this review, the meta-analysis of the literature on the use of mobile payment methods of Liu, Ben and Zhang [37] is worth mentioning. They found that – in addition to the usual factors as noticed usefulness, social factors, trust and noticed risk of mobile payment instruments – “the place where consumers live” [37, p., 575] may influence the use of these methods. This might be an empirical clue that the technology adoption theories are incomplete. Finally, the results of a study concerning a higher acceptance of mobile payments in Germany ([7], Fig. 7, p. 12) indicate the top five factors as follows: “Security and data protection”, “Lower fees than other payment methods” and “Easy and fast use”, “Widespread offering and acceptance”, “Fewer obstacles like PINs or passwords”, as well as “App with attractive products or services” and “Usage by family, friends and colleagues”. Moreover, those may also be the most important characteristics that drive the use of mobile payments in other (developed) countries. At least, the results of the above empirical studies do not seem to object to this list of driving factors. Theoretical papers on payment instruments are extensively reviewed by Leibbrandt [35]. Cash, card-based methods, as well as electronic money instruments are included in these analyses. In addition, a number of papers exists that also include the relevance of network effects; these are, too, reviewed by Leibbrandt. Research papers on sponsored and non-sponsored standards for payment methods are included there. The results of the reviewed papers are somewhat sobering. Most of the purely theoretical papers are too far away from real-world payment methods to be able to analyze them in a usage setting. The applied papers analyze different features of payment methods concerning their network effects and the question of standardization. Recently, Rysman and Wright [49] restricted their literature survey on the economics of payment cards. In particular, they paid attention to the literature on the effects of two-sided markets. Providers of payment instruments are in a position between merchants on the one side of the market and consumers on the other side. Therefore, interchange fees play a major role. Although this is an important aspect of payment instruments, and specially payment cards, the focus of this paper is on the technical aspects of novel mobile payment instruments and the consequences they have with respect to their adoption. Koulayev et al. [33] attempt to explain the use of different payment instruments in the U.S. In their model (Section 4, pp. 302–304), they assume a discrete choice model where consumers choose the payment method by maximizing their expected utility. Technical aspects of the payment technology are not considered. Nevertheless, the discrete choice approach is taken up in this paper, too. However, investigations that include the static and dynamic analysis of the adoption of Kranzberg-incomplete technologies are missing, as are studies that compare Kranzberg-complete and Kranzberg-incomplete instruments from a broad consumers’ (and merchants’) perspective. Shy [53, 54], Chapter 4, pp. 81 ff., may serve as an example of the prevailing theoretical approach to the adoption of technology advance. In a game-theoretic framework, the adoption of old and new, but complete technologies is modeled where consumers compete among each other. Since the technologies provide network externalities, early adoptions are risky and slow. Hence standardization is the next important theoretical topic for adoption. Of course, network externalities and standardization are always highly relevant topics in the presence of collective effects. However, these effects – as well as their policy remedies – are well studied and well-known. The question of the adoption of Kranzberg-incomplete technologies in the presence of Kranzberg-complete ones is not yet considered. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, salient payment characteristics are determined and the measurement of payment systems’ (dis)similarities is defined. Using the characteristics and (dis)similarities, the demand for payment systems is formalized. The topic of Section 3 is the incompleteness of the technical innovation package. In Section 4 the missing institutional and regulatory support of mobile payments is analyzed. Section 5 concludes.",

As an example of such technology, we can consider a digital personal assistant (DPA), like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s Bixby, etc. DPA can help users on various tasks, such as providing answers to different questions, setting schedule, sending messages, using household appliances, shopping, playing music, etc., by taking audio or textual orders [23, 25]. The global market of special home devices with DPA function (smart speakers) is expected to hit US$2 billion in revenues by 2020, almost a 500% rise over 2015 [29]. The number of individual consumer users of DPAs is predicted to increase from 390 million to 1.8 billion worldwide from 2015 to 2021 [60]. Hence, in the nearest future, it is expected that the demand for DPAs will only rise, and they will be used more regularly in everyday life of ordinary people. Considering the potential significant role, which DPA is going to play, the research work on this field suffers from lacking economic scholars’ attention at the moment. To our best knowledge, the only papers addressing economic perspectives of DPAs are the law-and-economics papers by Stucke and Ezrachi [23, 57], Gal [26] as well as Gal and Elkin-Koren [27]. All of the papers [23, 26, 27, 57] pointed out both competition issues and consumer welfare issues with DPAs. Stucke and Ezrachi [23, 57] explained how DPAs can influence consumers’ life and undermine competition. In addition, they briefly addressed the emotional nature of users, trust will be established between them and their DPAs, followed by decisions’ delegation from the user to DPA. Gal [26] specified different algorithms and their effects on consumers’ choices. Furthermore, the impacts of algorithmic assistants on autonomy were discussed from efficiency, psychological and liberty perspectives. From their law-and-economics perspective, Gal and Elkin-Koren [27] discussed the concept of algorithmic consumers as a potentially countervailing power to algorithmic supply-side tools and analysed its possible effects on market dynamics and welfare including aspects of, inter alia, algorithmic interactions, buyer market power and barriers to competition in digital markets. Schwalbe focused on the role of algorithms and their influence on the competition landscape of markets on firm level and without directly addressing DPAs [55]. Implications for regulations and competition laws are discussed in the end of these papers [23, 26, 27, 55, 57]. As DPAs are also based on (similar) algorithms, the insights from this literature are helpful for our analysis. The rest of the studies about DPAs are from technology development and application points of view. For instance, response correctness and naturality among Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant and Alexa is studied by López, Quesada and Guerrero [45]. DPA’s ability and improvement on managing tasks, reminding specific memories and managing calendar are researched widely during the recent decade [12, 52, 62, 63]. Some researches focused on developing DPAs for helping elderly and cognitively/physically impaired users [20, 24, 62]. Others devoted on specific functions as assisting maintenance of household appliances [25], telling customized stories to children [4], and planning activities aiming to build a long-term relationship with users [19]. The purpose of this paper is to provide an industrial-economics-based analysis of the economic interrelations between DPA service providers, third-party good suppliers, and consumers. In doing so, we extend the existing literature by pinpointing to the market conditions under which benefits may be reaped and those where consumer welfare losses may prevail, thus providing a more differentiated picture of the economic pros and cons of DPAs. Employing the insights from modern platform economics, behavioral economics as well as from the economics of personalized data and privacy, we 1) identify economic advantages and disadvantages for consumers using DPAs as personal butlers and 2) derive two conditions which are decisive for whether the advantages or the disadvantages of DPAs prevail, namely the degree of effective competition in the DPA market as well as the degree of rationality of consumer behavior. Eventually, 3), we conclude an important policy conclusion: since the rationality of consumer behaviour is notoriously difficult to influence by regulation, actively protecting and enforcing competition in the DPA market is of paramount importance to combat and limit the welfare dangers of DPAs and reap the economic benefits instead. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, our definition of DPA and its features are presented. Section 3 provides a description of the market for DPAs’. In Section 4, economic benefits of DPA usage are discussed, whereas Section 5 provides the discussion of potential economic challenges. Section 6 derives two conditions discriminating between benefits and challenges and concludes relevant first implications for policy and regulation.",3

Goel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The phenomenal growth in labor productivity in the U.S. since the mid-1990’s till around 2010 was a crucial factor in sustaining and restoring U.S. economic growth from economic downturns.Footnote 1 The previous dot.com collapse that began in 2000 and the following recession in 2001 could have created more severe consequences if not for the continuing strong growth in labor productivity in the nation during that time. Even after the Great Recession that began in 2008, the U.S. was still able to maintain growth in labor productivity, which helped the slow revival of the economy. Many economists attributed the episode of robust productivity growth in the U.S. to the unprecedented development of and investment in information technology (IT), especially since the second half of the 1990’s. With conflicting findings, a sizable literature in economics is devoted to verifying the contribution of either IT stock, as a form of capital stock, or IT usage by firms or industries to output or productivity growth before the dot.com collapse [5, 12,13,14,15,16, 21, 22]. In general, micro-level data appeared to be supportive of positive contributions of IT to output or productivity growth, but aggregate-level data at best revealed very little support. With the fast-growing popularity and use of web-browsers and the Internet technology across industries, households, as well as individuals since the late 1990’s and after, the economic effects of the Internet and its usage have gradually gained attention. Some studies in the literature investigated the microeconomic effects of the Internet on market structure, market behavior, and performance of firms [1, 3, 7, 10]. Others related the Internet to economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), inflation rate, and trade.Footnote 2 In relation to labor productivity growth specifically, Blinder [2], using U.S. productivity data from 1959 to 1999, proposed that the Internet is a possible cause of labor productivity acceleration in the latter part of the 1990’s. Goss [8] used U.S. industry-level data and found evidence that job-related Internet usage has a positive and significant impact on productivity growth of roughly 0.25% per year. However, his model also showed that Internet usage contributed negatively to productivity growth beyond a certain usage level, and that the literature after 1996 overstated the impact of IT stock on output and productivity growth by failing to control for Internet usage. While supporting a positive contribution of IT capital, including hardware, software, and communication equipment, to U.S. output and productivity growth in the late 1990’s, Oliner and Sichel [21] found, however, only very little contribution of Internet usage in the form of e-commerce to productivity growth. Litan and Rivlin [17] pointed out that the Internet could potentially increase productivity growth by reducing transaction costs, increasing managerial efficiency, and increasing market competition. Their results identified that the Internet contributed 0.2 to 0.4% to the growth of U.S. labor productivity. Using a cross-section of European firms in 2005 and looking from the e-commerce perspective, Nurmilaakso [20] found that Internet access has a significant and positive effect on labor productivity, defined as revenue per employee. Freeman [5] examined the impact of information and communication technologies on the U.S. labor market and found, among others, that computerization and Internet use resulted in a higher number of hours worked as well as higher hourly earnings. Goss and Phillips [9] found that on-the-job Internet usage contributed to a gain of 13.5% in U.S. average wage, using the 1998 Current Population Survey (CPS) data and assuming Internet usage as a proxy for IT skills. The more recent work by Najarzadeh, Rahimzadeh, and Reed [19] identified a positive effect of the number of Internet users per 100 persons on labor productivity by applying a Dynamic Panel Data approach to the data from 108 countries for the period 1995 to 2010. Only a few studies cited above investigated productivity growth through the effects of Internet use on individual workers or labor. It is an astonishing and non-deniable fact that the Internet has quickly penetrated workplaces, households, and the daily routine of individuals of all walks of life during the past two decades. For the OECD countries listed in Table 1, the average penetration ratio, defined as the number of Internet users over population size in 2000 was 26.1%.Footnote 3 By 2010, that average rate jumped up sharply to 73.4%, with the rates for Iceland, Norway, and Sweden being in the 90% range, while Australia, Finland, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, and UK all in the 80% range. In 2016, all except Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, and Portugal show rates above 80% or 90%. It is noted that Iceland and Norway have almost 100% penetration. For Mexico, the penetration rate was only 2.7% in 2000. The rate showed a 10-times increase in 2010 and then more than doubled in 2016. With the sharp increases in Internet penetration during the past decades, it is only natural to ask whether such a new way of life or work creates economic impacts, if any. People spent time on the Internet at work or during their leisure time, searching for job-related or non-job-related information or activities. As an integral part of the IT era, proper use of the Internet resources presumably has the benefit of educating workers in a faster and cost-saving way and making them more knowledgeable and hence more productive on the job. Firms may use appropriate Internet tools to streamline internal operations, conduct assessments, or enforce new or on-the-job training. Workers may spend time on the Internet outside of their jobs to absorb various types of new information that may directly or indirectly help them perform better at work. This aspect of Internet use seems to fit more snugly in a human-capital accumulation framework than in a straight production function structure, although the two must eventually be combined to complete the economic process. However, Internet usage can also be pure consumption or non-job-related. The booming of the computer gaming industry, for example, is an important driving force for the rise in Internet popularity, especially among the younger generation. It is already a fact that, for many of us, much of our daily life is spent on surfing the Internet through computers or smart phones for leisure purposes. This part of the Internet use may be counter-productive, since one can define it as a pure consumption-type activity which does not help individuals gain work-related skills or knowledge. The current paper attempts to provide empirical evidence on the nature and extent of the effect of Internet usage growth on the growth of labor productivity, while using the more recent cross-country OECD data. The proposed study modifies the traditional production function methodology by integrating Internet usage as a factor that improves the quality of labor. Extracted from the official OECD databases and an online source that specializes in Internet usage data (www.internetworldstats.com/stats16.htm), the data for OECD countries are adopted to perform the empirical work. A separate descriptive analysis for the U.S. is also conducted with the available historical data based on a survey, although this short data series does not allow a sufficiently rigorous empirical analysis [11]. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sets up the theoretical model and derives the estimated equation; Section 3 outlines the data and the variables adopted in the estimations; Section 4 analyzes the empirical outcome for selected OECD countries; Section 5 provides a descriptive analysis for the U.S. based on a unique data set; and Section 6 concludes.",5

An empirical analysis,December 2020,Muhammad Tariq Majeed,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"What are the essential causes of large differences in income per capita across countries? Why do some countries produce high and sustained levels of economic development and others do not and what determines economic growth? These questions have received substantial attention of the economists and policy makers at least since the time of Adam Smith. In the recent decades, one important line of research which focuses on ICT as a cause of economic growth has gained momentum. It is now widely believed that ICT development serves as a potential determinant of economic growth variations across countries. For instance, Quah [40] argues that the ICT revolution is improving broad-based education, labor skills and consumer sophistication. The increasing use of technology improves labor productivity and as a result economic growth increases. Levine [25] argues that ICT helps to relax barriers to information access that increases investment and growth. In recent years, e-government as another important force has captured the attention of researchers and policy makers to enhance economic development. E-government is referred to as the use of ICT by governments for “delivering and sharing” information and better services with the people [11, 22]. E-government applications promote economic development of an economy by assuring accountability and transparency in a country [9, 38, 45]. The theoretical research on e-government suggests that it improves the quality of services and responsibilities of public sectors [2, 46, 50], strengthens the role of the public and the democracy [46, 50], and mitigates malpractices and corruption prevailing in a society by assuring transparency and accountability [17, 18, 22, 35, 42]. In spite of the significant importance of e-government for various economic and social indicators, the empirical literature has virtually ignored the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and e-government for developing economies. This study contributes towards the empirical literature on e-government by determining growth effects of e-government for a large set of developing countries. Unlike previous studies, which focus on country-specific experiences or qualitative research reports, this study provides a broader picture of e-government and economic growth nexus for the developing world. The empirical analysis is based on Fixed Effects and Random Effects techniques. Moreover, this study also resolves the issue of endogeneity by using the SGMM estimation technique. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant empirical literature on e-government and economic performance. Section 3 discusses the empirical framework used in the study. Section 4 explains the data and provides a descriptive discussion of the data. In Section 5 we have interpreted the findings of our study by employing panel data models. Finally, Section 6 concludes with policy implications.",10
21.0,1.0,NETNOMICS: Economic Research and Electronic Networking,22 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11066-020-09139-3,"Media delivery competition with edge cloud, remote cloud and networking",December 2020,Xinyi Hu,George Kesidis,Zbigniew Dziong,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"A primary objective of network neutrality regulations is to address antitrust concerns, promote fair competition and innovation, and reduce costs for consumers [7, 11, 33]. Complicating the role of eyeball ISPs [22] concerning the content (digital media) they handle is the fact that many are themselves also content providers (over “managed services” they provide to their end-users) and content creators, and thus in competition with some content providers (CPs) that they enable over their commodity Internet service. Though this is a growing trend, considering AT&T’s recent attempt to acquire Time-Warner, the growth of Google Fi in America, and Facebook’s Express WiFi e.g., in India, some content providers/producers, e.g., Netflix, are not (yet) themselves a subsidiary of a network provider. Since the onset of the neutrality debateFootnote 1, researchers have extensively studied parsimonious models of the Internet marketplace to gain insight into the economic forces in play, especially to study the effects on competition (including barriers to market entry) and costs-to-end-users of non-neutral actions by ISPs. Performance is often assessed based on the Bertrand-Nash equilibria (NE) of noncooperative, decentralized games, and in terms of dynamical convergence to these equilibria, often considering limited resources (particularly bandwidth) as in classical Cournot games [5, 10]. The role of the regulator can be considered using a Stackelberg (leader-followers) game framework (discussed further below). For example, games involving end-users and content providers on an ISP platform were studied in, e.g., [12, 26]. Shapley values, indicating a fair division of revenue within a coalition (or cooperative game), are used to argue for side-payments between ISPs and CPs in, e.g., [22, 23] and the references therein. Pricing congestible commodities has been extensively studied [9, 32], e.g., in [16] a demand model is based on a “cost” that is the sum of a price and latency term. Extensive prior work has also used simple models to study the impact of: direct CP-to-ISP side payments for access or differential service to end-users, advertising revenue and/or direct subscription payments from end-users to CPsFootnote 2, network caching (e.g., [21, 30] and the references therein), and competition among ISPs and/or among CPs including CPs affiliated/integrated with ISPs. When network-neutrality regulations are/were in play, ISPs were prevented from demanding direct side payments from content providers for access to the ISP’s end-users/subscribers (origin neutrality). However, neutrality rules do not preclude asymmetric Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) at network-to-network interfaces (NNIs, or peering points) that are (neutrally) based on traffic aggregates. In this way, an “eyeball” ISPFootnote 3 can effectively demand additional payment from the transit ISP of a large (e.g., video) content provider. The transit ISP will naturally pass on these costs to the CP or be squeezed out of business forcing the CP to directly engage with the ISP - either way, a side-payment from the CP to the eyeball ISP effectively ensues, e.g., [18, 21, 25]. In previous related work, different scenarios for transit networks and content distribution networks (CDNs) [1, 24] were considered in [2], including those in which the CDN (or individual CP) is incentivized to compensate the transit network (ISP) to cache its content. [19] considered a neutral cloud and raised issues of fair competition in cases where public cloud providers compete with their tenants, e.g., both Amazon Prime and Netflix use (Amazon’s) AWSFootnote 4. In this paper, we consider a future marketplace also involving edge-cloud facilities run by the ISPs. One expects that service offerings of the edge cloud will largely involve VNFs and their service chains/graphs for the ISP, its subscribers and their content and service providers, but there may be other application-layer and general-purpose computing services that may be implemented there. One can also envision fog-computing customers employing a combination of (relatively cheaper) public cloud-computing services and fog-computing servicesFootnote 5. For example, a commercial video streaming provider may want to establish caches in the fog. One obvious benefit is the reduction in egress networking costs of its (remote) public cloud operations. Unlike the mid-2000s, when the majority of Internet traffic was unencrypted and pirated, today the majority of Internet traffic is encrypted mediaFootnote 6. That is, media is encrypted for specific end-users. One could encrypt for the ISP/edge-cloud in the public cloud, and then use the edge cloud to encrypt for individual end-users (i.e., both edge caching and computing). Considering heightened costs, objects of only the highest popularity would be cached in the fog. That is, a content provider’s edge-caches may not have a fixed amount of capacity and operate under, e.g., the least recently-used (LRU) eviction policy (e.g., [15]); instead the popularity of each active object would be directly estimated (e.g., [8, 31]), and only the objects whose estimated popularity exceeds a threshold would be cached in the edgeFootnote 7. A regulator would base its decisions on a model of the complex system considered herein. One can introduce many parameters in an attempt to, e.g., model the dynamic traffic characteristics of individual sessions/users. The parameters would need to be fit to different real-world datasets provided by the different parties. The validity of one party’s model and dataset would be contested by opposing parties. Thus, we propose to use a “lumped” non-cooperative game model of the complex system that could be agreed upon by the different parties, understood by the regulator, and used to determine how to regulate side payments (and yield other insights). We will see that, though the model is simple, it has an interesting behavior. Such models are typically evaluated in terms of their Nash equilibria (a stalemate among the competitors) if one exists and how the dynamics converge to it. A market regulator may wish to “steer” a Nash equilibrium to maximize a social welfare objective and avoid volatile cases where no Nash equilibrium exists, cf., Section 7. In this paper, we consider three types of content providers, see Fig. 1: 
 Those not affiliated with either (remote) cloud or edge-cloudFootnote 8. Those affiliated with remote-cloud providers, (e.g., Amazon Prime). Those affiliated with edge-cloud providers (ISP, e.g., AT&T U-verse). Three types of competing content providers: CP3 is affiliated with ISP/edge-cloud, CP2 is affiliated with the remote cloud, and CP1 is affiliated with neither Compared to the conference version [14], in this paper we extend the numerical study of the 3-player discrete-time iterated game, and further demonstrate how the three players converge to a unique Nash equilibrium or oscillate without a Nash equilibrium. In addition to the socioeconomic model of [14] and the case-study therein where the regulator favors one party, we herein also consider the case where the regulator is fair to all players. Finally, we also provide additional discussions regarding the implications of our study to the market and to neutrality regulations. We consider a marketplace for a single popular data object, e.g., a newly released commercial movie (arguably priced per download as assumed in the following for video-on-demand/pay-per-view service, instead of a flat rate subscription covering multiple videos). We describe our model in Section 2 and make a preliminary observation regarding the utilities in Section 3. In Sections 4 and 5, we explore the existence and uniqueness of the noncooperative game among the CPs for two different parametric cases; related numerical results are given in Section 6. In Section 7, we describe a leader-follower game involving a market regulator managing social welfare for the marketplace. We conclude with a summary in Section 8.",1

A classic example of network externality is a communications service, where the utility of each user increases as more users join in. Rolfs [22] describes the importance of a direct network effect as follows: “This is a classic case of external economies in consumption and has fundamental importance for the economic analysis of the communications industry”. Today, the rise of digital platforms, which mediate the interaction of different user groups, highlights the role of economics in understanding positive feedback and optimal pricing in the network economy [25]. For a profit maximizing monopolist, the main implications of positive network externality for the optimal price setting can be summarized as follows: first, pricing depends on how the consumers value the network externality and on consumers’ price sensitivity of demand; second, the price is set according to network size and is thus dynamic by nature, and third, the distribution of consumers’ unobserved preferences related to the service the network provides has a great impact on the dynamic price profile [27]. In this article, we focus on the dynamic optimization of platform pricing in industries with positive direct network externalities. The utility of the network for the consumer is modelled as a function of three components. Both the platform price and the network size (participation) affect the consumer’s decision to join the platform and the platform operator is assumed to know the consumers’ sensitivities with respect to these components. Thirdly, the consumer’s utility is a function of other attributes, such as network privacy policies and environmental effects of the service. We assume the platform operator knows the distribution of these preferences in the potential customer base. Our modeling results concentrate especially on the role of these unobserved preferencesFootnote 1 in optimal platform pricing. As an illustrative example, dynamic pricing of an electricity demand side management service (DSM) is simulated. The DSM service provider has a better view of the total electricity demand the larger the network size (pool of households) is. This is because the demand forecast errors of a single household cancel each other. Thus, the positive network effect in the DSM network arises from the improved forecasting ability of the service provider. We quantify the effect of unobserved preference distribution, consumer expectations and participation demand friction on the optimal pricing and on the network’s value. We draw general conclusions based on both analytical and simulation results. The structure of the paper is the following: related literature is presented in Section 2; a platform pricing model is presented in Section 3; a DSM service provider’s pricing example is presented in Section 4; conclusions end the paper in Section 5.",3

In order to meet the deadlines for the deployment of higher broadband speeds and to avoid the high deployment cost, many countries have adopted a partial transition to optical fiber network with Fiber-to-the-Cabinet (FttC) architecture. In areas where fiber to the home is not cost-effective, vectored DSL is a cost-effective solution for achieving downstream data rates of 100 Mb/s over 500 m by leveraging the existing copper infrastructure [27]. If vectoring is applied on a FttB architecture (100m from the customer’s premises), the downstream bitrate can exceed 200Mbps using VDSL2 35b profile [19]. However, the large number of lines (up to a few hundred) that coexist in the same cable, result in far-end crosstalk (FEXT), limiting the performance of VDSL2. Reducing interference with noise cancellation techniques enables the delivery of higher data rates which are closer to the theoretical maximum capacity of the line [7]. In order to apply the vectoring technology, an anti-signal is generated to cancel the crosstalk [22]. Although vectoring gives the ability to harvest the existing infrastructure to a greater extent reducing the cost, it relies on measurements from all the lines for obtaining the best performance [27]. Migration to vectoring involves all lines in the same cable to be controlled by a single service provider [20]. However, this restriction is contrary to the current regulatory framework which aims at promoting infrastructure competition. To solve this problem, fixed access network sharing (FANS) [4] and the single-operator vectoring (SOV) can be used. In Greece, the National Regulatory Authority decided to adopt the SOV implementation model [9]. Following all these, a new technology known as G.fast [13] brings user data rates up to 1 Gbps over copper-twisted pairs implemented with fiber-to-the distribution point architecture (FTTdp). FTTdp comprises a distribution point unit (DPU) connected to the central office by fiber while DPUs are installed closer to the customer premises (typically in mini cabinets or curb boxes) enabling bit rates of 500Mbps over 250m. Near-end crosstalk (NEXT) is avoided by using synchronized time-division duplexing, while FEXT is canceled using vectoring [20]. The deployment of this comprises a technological migration and G.fast will share the access network with existing DSL systems, particularly with vectored VDSL2. So, the coexistence of G.fast with legacy VDSL2 is a key to success of the new technology. In [12] after analyzing the coexistence of G.fast and vectored VDSL2 services in a distribution point deployment, it is shown that the deployment of spectral-compatible band plans is an effective means to improve vectored VDSL2 performance with tolerable impact on G.fast. Moreover, [24] investigate the performance of G.fast coexisting with VDSL2 and present a scenario where FttC locations can be upgraded to serve G.fast. Higher data rates are available for subscribers located close to the cabinet, while subscribers with longer lines or with legacy equipment are served with the legacy service. Finally, [21] conclude that G.fast brings DSL technology to a new level, comparable to the FttH grade of service. It allows operators to offer a total aggregated bit rate up to 1 Gb/s and low propagation delay. In September 2017, British Telecom, in an effort to upgrade its services, announced a limited deployment pilot of G.fast across the UK [2] and the service is delivered over the existing access infrastructure (FttC). Taking into consideration the common elements between the English and the Greek access network, namely the FttC architecture and the length of the copper cables which is shorter than 300m in both cases (allowing G.fast upgrade), we conclude that G.fast is probably the best option for upgrading VDSL2 vectoring technology. For all these reasons, we decided to apply this framework in a particular suburb of the city of Athens and discuss the financial aspects of these technologies.",1

From businesses to governments, digital technology has confronted traditional methodologies and foundational ideas, demonstrating that technology is genuinely disruptive. It has offered unprecedented opportunities for economic growth by providing access to information (both in real time), connecting people to businesses everywhere, opening up new markets, supporting accountability efforts in government, reducing cost and improving effectiveness and efficiency in operations. According to Friederici et al. [24], digital technology has transformed the very nature of economies with significant consequences for economic development. Despite the broad agreement that digital technology is now a serious part of any economy, there remains an absence of academic consensus about the actual impacts that digital technology has on the growth of economies. While the theoretical literature recognizes that digital technology plays an increasingly critical role in speeding up economic growth, empirical prediction of the type of relationship that holds have produced mixed results [8, 24, 49, 58] most times depending on the investigation methodology utilised and the geographical configuration considered. While some empirical studies confirmed that digital technology adoption plays a positive and significant role in improving economic growth, especially in developed countries (see [3, 8, 22, 56]), other studies found that economic growth in many countries and regions of the world is negatively affected by digital technology adoption [46, 61]. In developing countries, previous empirical studies employed different research methodologies and models, mostly using data from cross-country studies to understand the type of relationship that holds between digital technology and economic growth (see [3, 5, 40, 46, 49]). The results of these studies showed ambiguity, and thus reflected a strong disagreement in the research community on what a strong growth-enhancing effect of digital technology adoption means for a developing economy, leaving this issue open to further investigation. For Nigeria, there remains a dearth of studies on the impact of digital technology on the growth of its economy, as research in this area is still in the infancy stage, calling for the need for further exploration and discussions to produce a clear evidence base on the effect of digital technology on the economy. Such a study is critical because digital technology is now being classified in the General-Purpose Technology (GPT) category due to its implications not just for the economy, but for all aspects of life [16]. This is because digital technologies fit into the three key characteristics of a GPT as espoused by Bresnahan and Trajtenberg [14]. Firstly, they must be ‘pervasive’, implying that they should affect almost all sectors of the economy; for the developed country, digital technology is being used in virtually every sector, and for the developing world, its use has been rapidly surging. Secondly, they must improve over time and thus lower the costs for users; the cost of tablets, personal computers, and other technological hardware and software has significantly dropped over the years. Thirdly, they must stimulate innovation by making it easier to create and make novel products and/or processes; clearly, digital technology has enabled the introduction of a range of new products and services such as 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, driverless cars, cloud computing and the Internet of Things. An examination of the impact of such GPT to an economy is, therefore, very crucial not just for policymaking, but also for researchers and industry players, as it is a potent tool that could be used to advance the cause of different sectors. At the firm level, Carr [17] attempted to make a compelling argument that investments by corporates in IT, while critical, are less likely to deliver a competitive edge to an individual company. He posited that the ability of an organisation to leverage its technological capacity to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack strategically diminishes as such technology becomes accessible and affordable to all. While Carr’s article titled “IT Doesn’t Matter”, generated a lot of argument, given the perception the title created, his argument was not that IT was dead and can no longer be a source of rapid, even transformational change. Instead, the article argued that the odds are that the benefits of IT investment will be beneficial to whole industries rather than any single competitor. He further averred that instead of seeking competitive advantage through technology, corporates should manage IT defensively by watching the costs and avoiding risks. He concluded that the lesson to be learned from the past decades is that IT by itself rarely, if ever, confers strategic differentiation. In responding to Carr’s [17] piece, Brown and Hagel [15] averred that the choice of title of Carr’s article was unfortunate, as it attracted a readers’ attention, but truly misleading. This is because the article was actually not claiming IT does not matter; rather, the main assertion was that leveraging IT for competitiveness and as a source of strategic differentiation is diminishing. Despite the commentary, what remains clear is that IT is inherently strategic because it has indirect effects in terms of the creation of possibilities and options that did not exist before. Organisations that are ahead to see, and act on these possibilities before others will continue to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and enjoy economic rewards. Even with the ubiquity of IT, the ability and expertise to harness its potential will not also be ubiquitous, and here lies the opportunity for significant strategic advantage. At the macro-level, Carr [17] posited that there is no disputing of the fact that information technology has now become the backbone of commerce in any society. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [41], technology can truly enhance productivity and employment, and support reductions in inequality and the redistribution of income and wealth. Narrowing on productivity, Robert Solow in his seminal research on economic growth, found that most of the increases in the standard of living of humans have not come to be from an increasing amount of working hours, or the increasing utilisation of capital or other factors of production, but from improved productivity, that is the increase in the production efficiency, captured by the ratio of output to input. In turn, the source of growth in productivity stems from new technologies and new techniques of production and distribution [53]. For instance, in the mid-1990s, there was a surge in the rate productivity growth in the United States, and this was led by sectors that where IT-producing and IT-using; a change that has been attributed to the massive improvements in the nature and use of IT (see [33, 43]). Digital technology is a major factor in shaping the new global economy which produces rapid changes in societies and in recent times it has basically changed communication patterns and business engagements. At country-level, ICT allows countries to sidestep traditional stages or processes required for development and capability building, a situation termed as “technology leapfrogging” [13, 23, 42, 53]. In other words, it is the ability to use ICT to skip traditional paths through “bypassing some of the processes of accumulation of human capabilities and fixed investment in order to narrow the gaps in productivity and output” [54]. Again, even with studies that find that increases in digital technology adoption tend to be strongly correlated with the productivity/output of an economy, causality is yet to be resolved, and there remains the potential for endogeneity (the likelihood that the observed economic impacts of studies examining the impact of digital technology adoption, might not be a result of the latter, but caused by a third variable), simultaneity (the bi-directional impact between digital technology adoption and economic growth), and reverse causality (the potential that it is economic growth that causes digital technology adoption rather than vice versa). Most studies on digital technologies and economic growth in the literature (both developed and developing) are cross-country studies, and it may not be representative to treat all countries in aggregate groups as homogenous [30]. For instance, using a sample of 62 countries in different income levels, Yousefi [61] finds that ICTs have a higher impact on GDP in upper-middle-income countries than in low-income countries. This finding suggests that developing countries at different income levels extract value from digital technologies at different rates. Advancing the above and bridging the gap in the literature, this study is aimed at examining the impact of digital technology adoption on labour productivity and economic growth in the Nigerian economy for the period of 1990–2019. Specifically, this study will observe the growth in economic output and labour productivity only in terms of digital technology adoption by restricting the impact of other potential variables. Such an exercise necessitates a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) framework which models all endogenous variables jointly rather than one equation at a time, and also deals with the issue of identification common with regression of simultaneous equation models [35, 36]. This paper, therefore, uses a SVAR generalized economic growth model augmented with a digital technology variable to characterize the dynamic impact of innovations to the adoption of digital technology on GDP growth and labour productivity over the study period. Using Blanchard’s and Perotti’s [12] identification techniques, we aim to arrive at economically interpretable Impulse Response functions and Variance Decompositions and to show the short and long-term impact of digital technology shocks on growth in the Nigerian economy and its attendant labour productivity. VAR Granger causality will also be employed to confirm the direction of causality. The empirical research will provide answers to the fundamental questions of this paper, referring to the direction, intensity and duration of economic and labour productivity consequences of digital technological shocks. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical and empirical literature about the impact of digital technology on growth in economic output and labour productivity, including the main conclusions. Section 3 briefly explains the theoretical framework and econometric methodology used, as well as an identification of the models: the SVAR model. Furthermore, it sets out and describes the data used in the models. In Sect. 4 we present the main results from our analysis in terms of variance decomposition analysis and impulse response function analysis, and check for the stability and robustness of the model. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 5, where we offer recommendations for policy and practice.",3

Goel,Xingyuan Zhang,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Industry institutions play important roles in ensuring the protection of intellectual property and maintaining a level competitive field for their members. Certifications or validations by industry organizations can also impact firms’ conduct [27], whereas standards lower transaction costs by improving coordination and eliminating unnecessary duplication [29]. Among the numerous different industry institutions, Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) or Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) are responsible for international technology standards.Footnote 1 There are two broad classes of SSOs – those dealing with quality standards (e.g., ISO 9000), and those dealing with interoperability (e.g., MP3 format or USB). Examples of SSOs include The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), etc. Broadly speaking, SSOs and SDOs lower transaction costs, reduce the duplication of research efforts and prevent blocking patents. Without standards, it would be nearly impossible for firms to exploit economies of scale, as there would be barriers to mass production and communication. Every SSO needs a set of rules that addresses intellectual property rights (IPR) in order to ensure that the SSO owns its work or product upon completion, and to decrease the risk, or mitigate the hold-up problem that its completed standards will encounter IPR-based impediments to broad implementation [20, 9]. As indicated by many, SSOs have rules or policies relevant to the patent hold-up problem [39]. These rules, also called bylaws, or constitutions, etc., are often related to the procedures for setting standards and related to the policies applicable to standard-essential patents (SEPs) [5].Footnote 2 The latter mandate some form of disclosure and licensing of these SEPs. The most common IPR policy involves a requirement to grant licenses on “Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory” terms, often called a FRAND policy (see [19]). All these have implications for competitiveness and profitability that affect the incentives of firms to join SSOs. For example, SSO members might have competitive or informational advantages in competing with non-members or new entrants. Although SSOs develop many rules regarding procedures for setting standards or IPR policies for the SEPs, membership in SSOs is voluntary and a firm can potentially belong to several SSOs [4]. As indicated by Chiao et al. [14], few statistical studies have examined the relationship between the rules and operations of different SSOs, and little is formally known about the drivers of membership in SSOs. This paper attempts to add to the literature in this respect. Besides being of interest to SSO organizations themselves, information about the effective factors to join an SSO would be of interest to policymakers looking to regulate SSOs. This paper provides new insights into the composition and formation of SSOs by using a social network analysis to place firms in communities where they have the greatest affinity of characters or attributes and then a formal econometric analysis reveals firms’ propensities to belong to specific communities. We employ the Pajek softwareFootnote 3 with the Louvain community detection algorithm to place firms in a one-mode network into four communities or clusters where their characteristics most match each other in choosing different SSOs and then use multinomial logit to determine the significant factors such as licensing rules, disclosure requirements, as well as features of the decision process of standards, which may drive community membership. Pajek provides an impartial (rather than self-reported) way to characterize community membership. We place firms in 4 communities. Community 1 includes some leading telecommunication firms; Community 2 includes leading global firms that share more SSOs such as The Open Group (TOG) and Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS); the SSOs that firms are involved in Community 3 overlap with those in Community 2, but pay more attention to consumer technologies; and Community 4 includes some important firms that are technology and innovation leaders in defense, civil government, business applications, and cybersecurity solutions. How are firms placed in different SSO communities based on their common attributes? What determines firms’ membership in specific communities? To tie this research to the related body of knowledge, Lerner and Tirole [31] theoretically discussed the impact of forum shopping on SSO activities. Chiao et al. [14], on the other hand, empirically studied SSOs’ policy choices. They found a negative relationship between the extent to which an SSO is oriented to technology sponsors and the concession level required of sponsors. Along another related dimension, since Burt’s [13] foundational work, the study of structural holes has spanned the fields of analysis on firms’ innovation and IPR strategies (also see [10, 25]). As an alternative angle, relationships with the IPR rules and firms with SEPs may be investigated by the social networks, where firms choose different SSOs and identify which SSOs may be friendly to them. This is the route taken in the present research. Recent developments in the field of social network analysis could provide a possibility for visualization, facilitating analysis and interpretation of the behavior of “forum shopping” on the SSOs with necessary software tools (see [15, 33, 28]). Our results suggest a variety of strategies that firms use in choosing or staying in SSOs and provide more information on the effects of competition for IPR policies and policymaking processes between the SSOs and member firms. Some implications of these findings are discussed. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature overview and definition of SSOs and discusses the effects of SSO policies on IPR. Section 3 introduces the database we utilize in our analysis. Section 4 gives the image of the two-mode network of the participants (firms) and SSOs, and community detection by using a social network analysis software. Section 5 reports the formal empirical analysis, and Section 6 concludes.",5
22.0,1.0,NETNOMICS: Economic Research and Electronic Networking,09 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11066-021-09146-y,Big content providers weighing on non-neutrality?,June 2021,Patrick Maillé,Bruno Tuffin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"While the volume of data exchanged on the Internet has considerably increased in recent years [10], most of it is due to a very small number of content providers (CPs). As of 2015 in North America for example, Netflix and YouTube were accounting for more than 50% of all traffic [16]. The services those actors provide are very sensitive to the quality of the delivery of their flows to users; indeed they mostly offer high-definition video, a service that is bandwidth-consuming for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operating this delivery. To ensure the right service to their customers, those CPs report the quality provided by the various ISPs for their service. Google (owner of YouTube) is grading ISPs on a web page [4], depending on the end user’s location, based on how well they are able to stream YouTube videos, providing badges “YouTube HD Verified”, “standard definition” or “lower definition”. Here, Google joined Netflix, that was using the so-called ISP speed index [12] to measure Netflix performance on the different ISPs. It is then natural to assume that such information will be taken into account by customers when selecting an ISP to subscribe to; the choice would be based on the qualities advertised for their preferred services. In that sense, displaying the quality information can put some relevant competitive pressure on ISPs to upgrade their network; but it may also act as an incentive for ISPs to differentiate services and favor such big providers in order to receive the best grades and attract more customers, at the expense of small providers. Such a differentiated treatment among flows is directly linked to the network neutrality debate [3, 7, 9, 17], a debate that has been active for about twenty years, with regulations passed (and sometimes undone, as in 2017 in the US) worldwide [2, 8, 14]. The debate was initiated by ISPs demanding some financial compensation from heavy resource-consuming CPs to cover their network upgrading and maintenance costs, for the lack of which ISPs could block or throttle their traffic. It led to strong reactions from CPs and user associations, afraid of the potential impact on innovation and on the successful open network model. The pressure was then from ISPs on CPs; the threat considered in this paper is somewhat reversed: ISPs would tend to favor the biggest CPs without any financial compensation, to attract more subscribers. In this paper we propose a model to analyze the decisions of ISPs with regard to service differentiation of CP flows, in a context of two competing ISPs. One of the key components in such a game among ISPs will be the user preferences in terms of their interests for the different CPs; we assume a distribution over the subscriber population. Based on that distribution and on its competitor’s choice, each ISP has to determine the amount of capacity to devote to each CP. We, therefore, have a Stackelberg game [15], with 
 in a first stage, ISPs choose (in a competitive manner) the amount of their capacity to assign to each CP; in a second stage, given the ISP’s decisions and their own preferences, users choose which ISP to subscribe to, with congestion effects also taking place (an over-congested ISP becomes less attractive). As leaders in the game, ISPs are assumed to be able to anticipate user reactions to their choices. We, therefore, analyze the game using the backward induction method. Our goal is to investigate the best strategy of competitive ISPs in terms of capacity assignment to user-attractive CPs; should there be a differentiated treatment? What is the impact with respect to a “neutral” sharing where the capacity used for a CP is proportional to its total traffic? We have been able to characterize user equilibria as a reaction to the ISPs’ decisions (the above-mentioned second level of the game). Using this result, the (first level) ISP game is solved and compared with the neutral situation when ISPs allocate capacity to CPs in proportion to their traffic. Our results show that in this competitive context between ISPs, the optimal capacity allocation is non-neutral and symmetric, that is, the same proportion is allocated to each CP. The market shares of ISPs are the same for both situations, meaning that ISPs would not need to fight against neutrality. On the other hand, non-neutrality leads to different qualities at CPs but proved to have a better average perceived quality by users; so it should even be preferred by regulators. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model and the notations. In Section 3 we analyze the second stage of the game, that is the equilibrium among users when ISP choices are fixed. Section 4 then focuses on the first game level, that is, the game played among ISPs choosing how to treat CPs to attract more users. Section 5 compares the outcomes in the Nash equilibrium and in the neutral situation (when each ISP gives each CP a proportion capacity equal to its proportion of traffic). Finally, Section 6 concludes and presents the most interesting extensions of the model. For a better readability of the results, most of the proofs are deferred to appendices. This paper is an extension and a refinement of [11], in which users also had heterogeneous preferences among CPs, but all had the same usage pattern; we consider here a more realistic model where preferences are represented by different traffic patterns. It required a complete rewriting of the proofs and modified the numerical results.",1

At the same time, some licensed frequency bands held by governmental agencies are underutilized, leading to the emergence of the Licensed Shared Access (LSA) idea [12, 14]. LSA is a new concept, proposed by the Radio Spectrum Policy group (RSPG) in November 2011, which aims to optimize the use of spectrum, allowing the incumbents or the owners of the 2.3-2.4 Ghz bandwidth to temporarily share their spectrum with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Contrary to the traditional concept of sharing in which secondary users (MNOs in the LSA context) have no guarantee for accessing the incumbent’s spectrum, under LSA the duration and conditions of sharing are precisely defined beforehand by the regulator via a license. Deploying an LSA system requires the introduction of two new architectural blocks called the LSA repository–basically a database containing information about the LSA band such as conditions of sharing and duration–and the LSA controller which controls the access to the LSA bandwidth [14]. Several trials have been carried out to show the applicability of the LSA concept.Footnote 1 Since the objective of the LSA is to optimize spectrum usage, spatial reusability (MNOs who do not interfere should be able to use the same spectrum bands simultaneously) should also be leveraged. Spectrum reusability has been addressed in spectrum markets in the last decade [2, 4, 19, 20]; we will in particular consider a scenario in which multiple base stations of different operators compete for LSA spectrum at a defined period of time in a particular geographical area. In this scenario, a mechanism for attributing licenses needs to be adopted. A common approach is to design an auction mechanism, due to the need for information revealed by potential buyers. Designing an auction mechanism here raises two major challenges: it should take spectrum reusability into account, and it should be truthful (strategy-proof), i.e., each player should be incentivized to sincerely reveal their willingness-to-pay for the good (LSA spectrum in our context), independently of the other buyers’ behavior. In general, players are expected to try to manipulate the mechanism in order to maximize their profit, which may hurt other players’ (including the auctioneer’s) interests. For this reason, designing truthful mechanisms is very important. Several mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue. In [2, 18, 19], auction mechanisms are proposed for the case where there is only one spectrum block to allocate. LSAA [18] is the first auction mechanism which was proposed as a candidate for the LSA context. It performs well in terms of social welfare assuming truth-telling by bidders, but sincere bidding is not an optimal strategy for bidders. In [6], we modified the payment rule of LSAA to make it truthful. In [5], we have supposed that the available quantity of LSA spectrum allows to split it into several blocks and we have proposed an efficient one-shot auction mechanism. In this paper, we again suppose that the auctioned LSA spectrum is composed of K identical blocks, but contrary to the mentioned previous mechanisms which were sealed-bid one-shot auctions, we focus on “ascending auctions” where information is revealed by bidders during some convergence phase. Ascending auctions have been used with great success to auction spectrum and they are preferred to sealed-bid auctions [8]. Indeed, ascending auctions have several advantages over one-shot schemes: they preserve the privacy of the winning bidder(s) because the winner(s) do(es) not need to reveal their valuation. Also, they give bidders the opportunity to adjust their valuations over the convergence phase. This benefit of price discovery is ignored in one-shot auctions, which assume that each bidder perfectly knows his valuations. Another advantage is transparency: each bidder sees the evolution of the auction and may adapt his bidding strategy. There are several types of ascending auction mechanisms. In this paper, we base our contributions on two existing mechanisms that achieve the outcome of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction [7, 10, 17], known to be jointly truthful and efficient (the total value extracted from the resource is maximal): the model from Mishra and Parkes [15] uses the new concept of “Universal Competitive Equilibrium” (UCE) and applies to general valuations (items may be different), while the “clinching” mechanism developed by Ausubel [1] and detailed in Section 4.2 applies to identical items. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present those two mechanisms. Section 3 introduces our LSA model, and Section 4 presents our first contributions, namely adaptations of the UCE (U-LSA) and the clinching mechanisms (C-LSA) to the LSA context, i.e., encompassing spectrum reusability. We then show in Section 5 that each of those mechanisms has a one-shot auction equivalent, which helps us establish some key properties. Finally, the performance of those schemes is compared through simulations in Section 6, and we conclude and give some directions for future work in Section 7. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 
 We adapt the UCE auction to the LSA context (taking into account spectrum reusability), and highlight some computational complexity issues with the resulting mechanism (U-LSA), even when auctioned items (spectrum blocks) are identical. To deal with the computational complexity of UCE, we propose to adapt the clinching approach by proposing a new ascending mechanism which we call C-LSA. We propose a new one-shot mechanism that is equivalent to C-LSA, and use it to establish some properties of C-LSA in terms of truthfulness and revenue guarantees. We compare U-LSA with C-LSA through simulations, by comparing their equivalent one-shot versions, and show that C-LSA yields in most cases much larger revenues (with a multiplicative factor between 5 and 10) for a very limited cost in terms of resource usage efficiency (around 4%). Hence we think our proposed mechanism C-LSA is a viable candidate for LSA spectrum allocation and pricing applied in a wireless 5G network.",

Goel,Michael A. Nelson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The recent rollouts of coronavirus vaccines in many nations (and some others in development), coupled with the increasing infection cases/deaths from the disease, has added public- and political pressures to the expedited and widespread dissemination of the vaccines. Even the business sector has recently become concerned with sluggish vaccine rollout due to adverse implications for the speed of economic recovery.Footnote 1 This heightened interest has resulted in greater scrutiny of the rollout process, with some initial reports of inefficiency and mismanagement emerging.Footnote 2 Some nations have been better than others in vaccinating their populations; for example, Israel’s dexterity in vaccinating its population has received positive reviews.Footnote 3 While the institutional, economic, and geo-political factors vary substantially across nations, (and they might explain key reasons behind vaccination differences),Footnote 4 it is more surprising, even troubling, when subnational governments within a union exhibit substantial differences in vaccine rollouts. In the US, some states have been much better than others at vaccinating their populations, while others have lagged, sometimes due to no apparent reasons.Footnote 5 Some reports have sensed a lack of transparency behind a failure to understand differences in vaccinations across jurisdictions.Footnote 6 However, before any corrective policy measures can be undertaken, a good understanding of the factors driving vaccinations across US states is essential. It is towards that goal this paper is focused. Although new information about vaccination efficiency and coverage is literally emerging every day, it seems useful, both from an academic and a policy perspective, to analyze the available information in terms of the identification of bottlenecks in vaccinations. What are the significant factors driving the delivery of vaccines? Are the determinants of vaccine delivery different from the drivers of vaccine delivery efficiency? In this respect, we examine both the dissemination or diffusion of vaccines (vaccines actually administered) and the efficiency in their delivery (what percentage of vaccines that a state received were actually administered) during the early stages of the vaccine rollout in the US. Given the gravity of the underlying health and economic consequences surrounding the pandemic, the speed and spread of vaccinations are of paramount importance both to the public and the policymakers. An identification of significant factors facilitating vaccinations and promoting the efficiency of vaccinations would be useful information not only for jurisdictions where vaccinations are underway but also in areas that are looking to start vaccinating their populations. Some literature on the economic aspects of the pandemic has emerged, examining various aspects (see, for examples, Alfano and Ercolano [1], Asongu et al. [2], Baldwin and Weder di Mauro [3], Farzanegan et al. [7], Goel et al. [10], Goel and Nelson [12], Persad et al. [15], Price and van Holm [17], Roccato et al. [18], Salvatore et al. [19]). This paper adds initial formal research to the success of ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the drivers of the administration and delivery efficiency of coronavirus vaccines in the early stages of the vaccination campaign in the US. For this purpose, we use data from the 50 US states and place the formal analysis in the context of socio-economic drivers of vaccinations. Results show that state-economic prosperity and rural population aid both vaccine administration and delivery efficiency. Furthermore, more populous states have a weaker record for both outcome measures, at least in the early stages of the vaccine rollout campaign. Delivery efficiency improves in states with more nursing homes per capita, in states with more COVID-19 deaths, and those with more health workers. On the other hand, vaccination efficiency was lower in states with a centralized public health agency. States with a larger share of the elderly population and those with Democrats as governors were no different from others with regard to vaccinations. Finally, a state’s legacy of corrupt activity is broadly consistent with the greasing effects of corruption in improving vaccine administration and delivery efficiency.

Widespread broadband diffusion encourages innovation, contributes to productivity and economic growth. Fixed broadband (whether it is DSL or fiber) is defined as transmission capacity with sufficient bandwidth to permit the combined provision of voice, data, and video through a fixed line. Mobile broadband provided by 3G and 4G mobile systems supports today similar data transport rates, turning it into a very competitive technology. Today, broadband networks are an essential enabling infrastructure and technology adapted in all modern knowledge-based economies. As broadband becomes a commodity in households, it still enables the digitization of adopting sectors including energy, health, education, manufacturing and financial services leading to smarter societies with easier and more efficient information exchange and processing. Despite the overall rapid growth of broadband diffusion, many countries are still in the dilemma between fixed and mobile broadband deployment. Government authorities and regulators had to assess and develop policy strategies or even spectrum availability to promote faster adoption and services’ bundling based on demand. There are still many countries that rely heavily on fixed broadband and fiber networks where others manage to deploy usually first fixed and then mobile broadband in various time plans and penetration rates. Although there is significant literature on fixed broadband diffusion, there are still very few empirical studies examining the important and influential factors of fixed and mobile broadband diffusion with the Gompertz model. As the results are not always consistent, there is no empirical OECD broadband study yet to our knowledge, and since mobile broadband deployment took off during the past decade, investigating the effects and countries’ behaviors. We managed to collect a complete dataset since the very early diffusion of technology per year and study the OECD countries’ behavior, which we believe adds value to the paper’s methodology and results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the broadband technologies’ behaviors and their performance over time in the OECD area. It is interesting to examine heterogeneous and symmetric effects across our sample data and also estimate and compare the Gompertz model’s variables, saturation and inflection time, per country and per technology. As such, applying the Gompertz growth curve among other models suggested in the literature, in a time series dataset, we compare different groups of countries based on the stage of innovation. We find that although the diffusion time is similar for both technologies, the mobile broadband diffusion’s inflection time is asymmetric over the symmetric fixed broadband. The adoption time is almost double compared to the fixed, revealing a strong preference mostly of the developed countries on fixed broadband technology. Although OECD countries have been categorized into five groups based on the stage of innovation and Roger’s theory, only three of these groups agree with Roger’s categorization. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the existing literature on OECD studies, fixed and mobile communications diffusion, Section 3 presents the research methodology with the data, the model and the classification method, Section 4 presents the empirical results and Section 5 conclusions and Section 6 some suggestions on future work.",

Neelakanta,Aziz U. Noori,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the context of long-term evolution (LTE) of modern wireless networks, a rational strategy to prescribe an apt performance measure on mobile services and platforms that support smart-devices (concurrent to traditional feature (cell) phones), warrants a comprehensive model. Traditionally, tariff-related parameters in conjunction with technology-specific details are regarded as appropriate candidates towards prescribing a cohesive performance metric thereof, while comparing services rendered by telecommunication companies (telcos) in related mobile operations. Mostly, such performance comparisons of mobile services are done on the basis of visible technology-dictated features (such as the speed of wireless traffic in bps); and, the underlying mobile networks are comparatively assessed by ranking them in terms of being the “fastest network” attribute in the service area considered. Correspondingly, a mobile speed index (MSI) is prescribed and explained in [31,32,33,34,35,36]. Sparsely included however, in such performance evaluations are inherent economics-related facts and productivity enhancement considerations (as a result of mobile device usage) relevant to services areas across the periods of assessment. As such, an expanded scope of performance assessment has been specified via a relative techno-economic performance index (RTPI) as proposed by the authors elsewhere in [23]. The present study offers yet an extended level of performance comparison of mobile services by including hedonic heuristics and associated price-worthiness aspects of such services, which are cast as overlay information upon MSI and RTPI considerations; hence, an appropriate measure of performance is proposed and named, the hedonic pricing index (HPI). It is based on the so-called hedonic heuristics, which is adopted in distinct market assessments of a variety of goods and services [2,3,4, 8,9,10,11, 13, 14, 16,17,18,19,20, 30, 38, 39, 42]; and, it is considered here towards assessing the performance of mobile services, (specifically, in the contexts of those supporting the co-diffusion of smart- and feature-devices). Hence, included in framing the said HPI are considerations pertinent to a preferential or ‘choosy’ attitude of subscribers (depicting the hedonic mindset) vis-à-vis their willingness-to-pay (WP) (if necessary even more!) for certain dedicated service profiles of their choice. The HPI prescription is also consistent with the eventual tariff scheme adopted by service providers matching their willingness-to-accept (WA) strategy implicated by return-on-investment (RoI) and other budget constraints. The underlying motivational considerations, as well as the scope of the present study is presented prior to such HPI-specific analysis. Accordingly, this paper is structured as follows: In the following section (Section 2), a review on modern mobile networks as they prevail in the context of LTE is presented. Then, the background details in assessing relative performance of such mobile networks in terms of MSI and RTPI parameters (as indicated in [23]) is briefly outlined in Section 3. Further, commensurate with the proposed method of adopting hedonic heuristics in prescribing the price-worthiness attribute to services rendered (in a specific service area) and deducing thereof the HPI under discussion, a basic tutorial is presented in Section 4 on hedonic concepts; and, Section 5 outlines the methodology of evaluating the HPI. Further, compiling relevant data towards computing and ascertaining the results on MSI, RTPI and HPI vis-à-vis an exemplary set of wireless networks and services is outlined in Section 6. Discussions on the proposed considerations and the obtained results are depicted in Section 7; hence, the foreseeable limitations of hedonic aspects of HPI modeling and price-worthiness in specifying the performance of mobile networks and services are identified and discussed. Further, the computed details pertinent to the relative performance of mobile networks are cross-verified against actual prices levied by incumbent mobile operators in a test service area over a known period of time. Lastly, the observed details are rationally considered with conclusive remarks in Section 8.",

This initiative has established ambitious targets for the EU as a whole in terms of broadband speeds. In particular, by 2020 all households should have been able to benefit from a fast broadband subscription of 30 Mbps or higher and 50% of the households to take up subscriptions of 100 Mbps or higher. Unfortunately, in terms of ultra-fast broadband subscriptions only 26% of the European homes subscribe to at least 100 Mbps and 50% to at least 30 Mbps speeds, respectively [24]. Such figures indicate a rather unsatisfactory roll-out in relation to EU’s 2020 targets. This can be attributed to EU’s regulatory environment the main principles of which constitute a crucial determinant for achieving DAE goals in terms of connectivity improvement. Unfortunately, these are not always aligned with market developments and trends and sometimes refrain from providing telecommunications operators with the appropriate investment incentives relative to super-fast broadband infrastructure deployment [7]. The importance of high-speed broadband and the benefits it brings has been acknowledged in the literature in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth ([40, 19, 33, 8, 41]), productivity ([56, 57, 11, 10]), job creation ([17, 18, 29, 42]) and consumer surplus [4]. Given that, the EC released Recommendation 2013/466/EU on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies for the promotion of competition and the enhancement of the broadband investment environment [23]. Its objective is to reconcile competition and investment via allowing for flexibility in the pricing of new wholesale NGANs products, while ensuring stable wholesale copper access prices. The Recommendation, among others, introduces the concept of the Economic Reliability Test (ERT). The latter has in view, according to recital 62 of the Recommendation, to “…ensure, in combination with the other competitive safeguards introduced such as EoI,Footnote 1 the technical replicability test, and a demonstrable retail price constraint resulting from a copper anchor or alternative infrastructures, that SMPFootnote 2 operators do not abuse this pricing flexibility to exclude potential competitors from the market”. The test itself assesses “…whether the margin between the retail price of the relevant retail product and the price of the relevant NGA-based regulated wholesale input covers the incremental downstream costs and a reasonable percentage of common costs” [23, p. 31]. Furthermore, the Recommendation also suggests that the profitability of flagship products should be measured on the basis of a DCF approach. Also, it has taken a keen interest in employing the Equally Efficient Operator (EEO) standard to demonstrate whether the incumbent’s retail arm can trade profitably if charged the same price as its competitors by the incumbent’s wholesale arm. Recital 64 advocates that the usage of EEO standard “…enables NRAsFootnote 3 to support the SMP operator’s investments in NGA networks and provides incentives for innovation in NGA-based services” [17, p.20]. On top of that the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) followed by issuing guidelines for NRAs on how an ERT should be conducted in practice [5]. Another report was prepared for the European Telecommunications Network Operators (ETNO)‘s association by the Charles River Associates (CRA) consulting firm pertinent to ERT. It recommended a consistent and proportionate approach regarding the parameters and procedures of the ERT after analyzing both the Recommendation 2013/466/EU and BEREC guidelines in the context of NGANs service provision [14]. In academic literature, Jaunaux and Lebourges [39] were the first to discuss the issue of ERT implementation, followed by Charalampopoulos et al. [13] who examined the impact of a possible deviation from Net Neutrality (NN) rules in the EU on ERT conduct. Results of Jaunaux and Lebourges [39] showed that reconciliation between investment and competition can be achieved under certain hypotheses: First, the wholesale access price is seen as a two-part tariff comprising from a fixed-part, invariable to the volume of access, and a variable part which depends upon the number of subscribers. Second, only the latter is included in the ERT. In other words, the fixed-part is omitted from calculations. To support their claim, the authors used a simplified but representative numerical example based on a Fiber-to-the-Home (FttH) investment opportunity to illustrate that conducting an ERT using a DCF method which includes the fixed-part of the wholesale access price in the calculation process could deliver a negative result. Such outcome implies that the investor operator is engaged in a foreclosure strategy, even if no form of discrimination is taking place whatsoever. This paper investigates in a NGAN infrastructure investment scenario i) the impact the absence/presence of long-term access pricing agreements can have on ERT conduct and ii) possible ROT incorporation in ERT implementation. The goal is to examine whether it is possible not to omit the fixed part of the wholesale access price from calculations and at the same time improve ERT results obtained via the use of the DCF approach. ROT usage in telecommunications regulation has exhibited a focus primarily on risk premium (e.g., [21, 50, 15]) and the option to delay (e.g., [20, 47, 48, 9, 30]), and secondarily on other issues such as the timing of an investment decision and the setting of regulated access prices (see [12, 34]). The organization of the article is as follows. Section 2 provides a short overview of ROT usage in telecommunications regulation so far. Section 3 presents the ERT methodology and implements it in the absence/presence of long-term access pricing agreements. Then it is examined how Real Options (ROs) can be incorporated in the DCF approach. Section 4 discusses the obtained results whereas Sect. 5 provides the concluding remarks of the article with a review of its main results.",

For example, telecommunications infrastructure could either influence the demand for, and supply of transportation services through its electronic impulses [59, 77]. A relatively vast number of empirical studies has highlighted the significant role that telecommunication infrastructures/ICT play in promoting economic growth and development in the literature (inter alia: [24, 25, 27, 30, 47, 48, 53, 61, 64, 80, 90, 106, 117, 119, 120]). Slightly over a century, after Graham Bell's invention of the telephone in 1876, the telephone and other developed modes of telecommunication have reached almost every part of modern society as a new medium of telecommunication technology [27]. The examples of spectrum of telecommunications infrastructure services that serve the modern society/sectors of the economy include: voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) technology; setup of standard telephone systems and data networks; radio antenna testing; installation of optical fibers; soft switches; site location for the cell tower; media gateways; mobile portals; billing and mediation systems; and general packet radio service (GPRS) technology [27]. They are most often provided by the Internet service providers (ISP), satellite companies, and phone companies. The services provided by the telecommunications/ICT industry facilitate investment, industrial and economic activities and this is because they help to reduce the cost of transaction [83, 92]. Apart from the importance of telecommunications infrastructure services/ICT to economic activities, it could also play a cogent role in strengthening and improving security against present and potential future attacks by identifying potential threats, aiding information sharing, providing mechanisms to safeguard nations, and developing response capabilities. Since the telecommunications infrastructure services/ICT is used by the defence personnel/sector across the world there is need to investigate the role it plays in the defence sector. As the defence sector is managed and maintained by the governments across the world through defence spending, there are also efforts by governments to integrate telecommunications infrastructure services/ICT into military/defence operations. This is evident because the defence sector is involved in ICT-related analytical capabilities, extensive networks of sensors, control, command, programming etc. that provide information directly to the warfighter and to smart weaponry on an immediate and real-time basis. In this study, in order to capture the role that telecommunications infrastructure plays in the defence/military sector, the defence/military sector is measured by defence spending. This is because according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) (2020) defence spending “refers to all government spending on current military forces and activities, including salaries and benefits, operational expenses, arms and equipment purchases, military construction, research and development, and central administration, command and support”. Also, since the establishment of SIPRI in 1966, the organisation has not failed to be a reliable source of data on defence spending for the world. The SIPRI defence spending database has been used widely by researchers and scholars in different fields to examine/discuss a wide variety of relevant issues related to the defence sector [58]. In the light of multiple circumstances and factors, the government demand for defence spending is usually on the basis of providing security (both external and internal) for economic activities. And that is why national security is the most significant consequence of defence spending [110]. Theoretically, there are three basic channels by which defence spending could be linked to growth, namely, demand, supply, security channels [58]. These channels help to theorise the potential effects of defence spending/sector on growth, which could either be positive, negative or no relation. Studies have extensively examined the relationship between defence spending and growth without reaching a conclusion on the direction relationship that exists between them. And that is why the debate on the nexus between the two variables and other macroeconomic variables still remains an ongoing one [29, 94,95,96,97, 100]. The reasons behind differences in results and conclusions from the previous studies in the literature could be linked to the application of different econometric methods, theories, sample periods etc. The results on the defence spending-growth nexus for cross-country and specific country studies could generally be grouped into positive, negative and negligible outcomes (inter alia: [23, 28, 34, 36, 37, 49, 57]). Although most of the previous studies tend to support the negative effect of defence spending on growth, which points to the growth retarding nature of the spending when it is not well utilised [57]. The lack of consensus in the literature concerning the defence spending-growth nexus calls for further investigation by taking into account the role that telecommunication infrastructures/ICT plays. Previous studies have considered: (i) the role that investment, stock market, trade openness, poverty and inequality, employment etc. plays in the nexus between defence spending and growth (inter alia: [58, 111, 116]); and (ii) the knowledge economy effects of formal institutions, entrepreneurship, globalization, peace and stability etc. (see, for example, Andrés et al. [5], Asongu and Tchamyou [11], Amavilah et al. [4], Tchamyou [113] among others). Meanwhile, the role that telecommunication infrastructures play in the nexus between defence spending (proxy for defence sector) and growth has suffered neglect in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the telecommunication infrastructures impact on defence spending-growth nexus. Filling this gap in the existing literature is important because: (i) as insecurity is ravaging different parts of the world, telecommunications policies need to be defence sector/security-friendly; (ii) according to Choudhary et al. [22], the key factors that could contribute to telecommunication infrastructural/ICT development include defence spending, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) etc., which could be adequately utilised for the war against insecurity in countries worldwide; (iii) defence spending could have technology spin-off effects on other sectors and possible security externalities; and (iv) the unavoidable defence/security challenges that tend to lead to the eventual destruction of lives, assets and the environment requires a comprehensive approach through the effective use of telecommunications infrastructure services/ICT. Given the multifaceted role that telecommunication infrastructures/ICT play across all the sectors of the economy, this study contributes to the literature in the following ways: (i) by examining the defence sector growth nexus of telecommunication infrastructure for 157 countries spanning from 2000 to 2018. As mentioned earlier, to measure the defence sector, defence spending serves as the proxy, while growth is measured by the real gross domestic product, and telecommunication infrastructures are measured by a composite index of telecommunication (which is comprised of mobile line, fixed line, and internet access penetration) via a principal component method; (ii) according to Saba [98], defence spending can bring about some possible differences in its economic impact among countries because of the productive structural base and development levels. We herein disaggregate our data into four income groups based on the World Bank classification of the world's economiesFootnote 1. We have the following reasons for classifying the panel data into four income levels. First, we have a dataset including 157 countries, which lets each subpanel contain enough data to test. Second, investigating telecommunication infrastructures-defence spending-growth nexus for countries within the same income level will reveal the direction of causality among our variables for a more homogenous group of countries that may have relatively more homogenous economic or socioeconomic and political behaviours. Third, the different results obtained will give the opportunity to compare the relationship between telecommunication infrastructures, defence spending and growth for the income groups. Consequently, the critical question of whether one size really fits all in terms of the causality between telecommunication infrastructures, defense spending and economic growth may also be investigated; (iii) Unlike the previous studies, this paper utilises the most recent Abrigo and Love [1] proposed GMM estimator panel causality test. Their novel panel causality test addresses problems of endogeneity via instrumentation in the panel-VAR model. According to Nickell [82], when the lagged dependent variable is used as a regressor, the panel-VAR model estimates appear to be biased. But Abrigo and Love [1] argue that in the presence of a lagging dependent variable as a regressor, the GMM estimator will yield consistent estimates in a panel-VAR model. Hence, the reason why we use their panel causality approach to achieve the objective of this paper. The remaining sections of this study follow this order. In Section 2 we review related literature; Section 3 presents methodology and data sources; Section 4 presents the empirical results and discussion; and Section 5 concludes with policy implications.",4

Although, the economic dimensions of ICT are well researched, the environmental aspects are usually ignored. However, in this digital age, CO2 emissions are a global challenge, and they go beyond the national borders. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the climatic implications of ICT for a global panel of developing and developed countries while addressing the climate change challenges. ICT is a special case of technologies that assists in more innovations and encourages economic performance. ICT diffusion initiates new business opportunities which encourage the competitiveness of an industry and stimulates investment in different sectors of the economy. Quah [35] explains that ICT overcomes time and space constraints, accelerates the delivery of information and reduces information asymmetry. Moreover, ICT improves health outcomes, labor skills, market transparency, financial transactions and an efficient allocation of resources [20, 26, 29, 33, 37]. On the other hand, financial development (FD) is regarded as an important ingredient of economic growth [10]. The financial sector acts as a link between the deficit and surplus sectors of the economy. In addition, the financial sector mobilizes funds, reduces transaction costs, promotes inter-industry transactions and distributes resources into the highest productive investments [37]. Schumpeter [41] discusses that the development of the financial sector increases the efficiency of resource distribution while Raheem and Oyinlola [36] explain that FD enhances mobilization, utilization, and monitoring of funds. It is believed that FD upgrades material and human capital accumulation, brings about allocative efficiency and leads to higher levels of economic development [9, 29, 42, 43]. Recently, there has been substantial development in the financial sector which is closely linked with ICT diffusion. The financial sector has spent more than US$197 billion on ICT products and services in 2014 [10]. In addition, the financial sector is the single largest buyer of ICT products and services ever since the 1990s. Since the 1980s, the development of the financial sector has been based on the transmission of digital information. ICT facilitates financial access by reducing the cost of marketing and enhances market participation by decreasing information asymmetry [10]. Moreover, ICT supports competition among financial institutions and significantly improves their operating efficiency. It is suggested that ICT may further enhance the development of the financial sector. For example, internet usage reduces processing, information, and transaction costs and accelerates investment activities. Therefore, it is believed that the further usage of ICT appliances and communication devices in the financial sector may expand access to credit facilities, broaden the export base, ensure a more efficient allocation and monitoring of resources as well as substantiate financial inclusion [37, 43]. While ICT plays an important role in economic and FD, it also influences CO2 emissions. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions are identified as the primary source of climate change. However, the carbon implications of ICT are yet unsettled [1, 26, 33]. The relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions remained complicated because ICT exhibits differential impacts on carbon dioxide emissions. The ICT optimizes production processes, improves energy efficiency and reduces emission intensity which negativelyFootnote 1 impacts (i.e. reduces) CO2 emissions. In contrast, the ICT sector consumes large amounts of energy during production, processing, installation and distribution of ICT products which positively influence (i.e. increases) CO2 emissions. Therefore, the ICT has diverse impacts on CO2 emissions [37]. On the other hand, the financial sector has a deeper and wider application of ICT as compared to many other sectors. Actually, the financial sector is the largest consumer of ICT products and it focuses on the expansion of ICT infrastructure [10]. Now, an important question arises: Does FD influence CO2 emissions positively or negatively? Notably, if the usage of ICT products in the financial sector leads to energy efficiency, it will negatively impact CO2 emissions. Instead, ICT may boost FD but poor environmental conditions may also arise from the usage of ICT products in the financial sector, if ICT products consume large amounts of energy. Unfortunately, the carbon implications of FD are rarely focused. Therefore, the exact effects of FD on CO2 emissions are difficult to ascertain and need further investigation [33, 43]. In the presence of ambiguity, an investigation of the relationship among ICT diffusion, FD and CO2 emissions is relevant for this study. Although there are a few studies that investigate the relationship among ICT diffusion, FD and CO2 emissions, there are some gaps in the existing literature. Firstly, the results are inconclusive whether ICT and FD improve or degrade environmental quality [33, 37, 43]. Secondly, the impact of ICT is usually studied with one indictor while the ICT index has not yet been studied comprehensively along with FD and trade openness. Thirdly, most of the earlier studies have used panel data models which generally did not account for the problems of cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity [26]. It may be one of the reasons for the inconclusive results of the earlier studies. These gaps motivate us for the further analysis of carbon implications of ICT. Hence, the present study explores the effects of ICT, FD and trade openness on CO2 emissions for a global sample of 92 countries covering the period from 1990 to 2018. We employ alternative panel data estimation techniques such as pooled ordinary least squares (POLS), the fixed effect model (FEM) and system generalized method of moments (SGMM) with panel corrected standard errors to address the cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity issues. Mainly, our study contributes in the context of the 21st conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention (Paris Agreement or COP21) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which put emphasis on the mitigation of climate change. Moreover, the empirical investigation of carbon implications of ICT in developing countries is scarce in the literature. Therefore, our focus is a global sample which includes developed as well as developing countries. Furthermore, we construct an index of ICT with the principal component analysis (PCA) to better understand the climatic consequences of ICT. The study is structured as follows: Section 2 studies the relevant literature on ICT, FD, trade openness and CO2 emissions. Section 3 discusses the methodological framework for the analysis while Section 4 describes the data and construction of the variables. Section 5 reports and analyses the estimation results. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the study with some policy recommendations.",

The population of OSs is constantly increasing with content that becomes multimedia-richer, “heavier,” and, structurally, far more complex. In this evolving ecosystem, we aim to rationalize the reservation and use of CDN resources from both the OS (client) and the CDN perspectives. The use of CDN resources needs to be carefully planned in the space-time domains. The CDN gradually shifts its attention to more fine-grained resource management schemes that minimize overheads (unused capacity, etc.). Schemes and techniques for more accurate resource claims are of common interest as they positively impact the involved clients (OSs) and the CDN operator/provider. Resource utilization can be maximized and, thus, advance the pertinent economy in total (i.e., improve the position of both sellers and buyers). CDN providers can deliver better services to a broader audience at more competitive prices. Furthermore, improving resource utilization may result in the reduction of network congestion. We adopt an improved framework for the methodical management of CDN resources. Specifically, we borrow concepts and techniques from the capital market [37, 58, 62, 63]. We treat the CDN resources (assets) as (capital) stocks. The stockholders are the content-generating organizations (OSs). According to the client needs for resources, stocks are purchased dynamically, aiming to sustain the experienced visitor load efficiently. The CDN monitors the incoming traffic of each client and learns the temporal distribution of their resource use (bandwidth) to protect against resource οver/under-use. This knowledge is of utmost importance for the rationalization of CDN resource management. Using the proposed LPM, the CDN then establishes load predictions for the immediate future to reserve resources for the OS well beforehand and, thus, cope with the fluctuating load. Resources can be claimed from the CDN but also traded among clients (Fig. 1). A tool for trading CDN resources, which improves the resilience of the LPM to forecasting failures, is the capital SM. CDN resources are traded in the SM by the actual proprietors (i.e., clients that have already acquired resources but experience load incompatible with their expectations/predictions). Basic framework structure This paper introduces another tool that further improves the forecasting and resource trading mechanisms’ resilience, the capital SOs. According to CDN predictions, each OS buys SOs at prices and for the duration specified by models such as that of Black-Scholes (BS) [37], Barone-Adesi & Whaley [3], Bjerksund & Stensland [8], Ju & Zhong [38], and Binomial and Trinomial Trees [19]. These SOs are exercised if and when needed (i.e., if an OS runs out of resources at the end of the billing period and cannot locate any available surplus in the SM). Overall, this resource management scheme (Fig. 1) is essential for CDN providers that “lease” finite resources (bandwidth) from other operators. The latter stakeholders (higher-level entities) constitute a meta-level in the CDN ecosystem (meta-CDN). We access the performance of the proposed scheme using extensive real traces taken from high traffic OSs, such as chambers of commerce, universities, popular sports content websites, and e-commerce websites. Our findings show that the introduction of the SOs enables the proposed framework to further “absorb” forecasting failures and optimize CDN resource management. We compare the proposed framework with other plans currently being used in the market. We argue that this capital market metaphor is a well-suited option for structuring the modern World Wide Web (WWW) ecosystem. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work and Sect. 3 presents the architecture of the proposed framework. Section 4 describes current CDN pricing policies on the market. Section 5 deals with the simulations we choose to perform, describes their related parameters and discusses the corresponding metrics and results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work.",

While developed countries of North America, Western Europe, and Asia are driving their economies with sophisticated and advanced technology, most developing countries seem to be lagging behind, due to their inability to invent high technology. They are, therefore, largely dependent on the acquisition of already invented technology from the developed countries. In particular, African countries rely heavily on imported IT to enhance production, industrialization, and economic growth. IT facilitates capital flows, hence African countries are willing to embrace and use it to attract more inflows. These countries, within limits of their financial capacity, are striving to adopt and utilize the latest IT, for the purpose of driving economic growth and development. IT is generally acclaimed to be a vital facilitator of capital flows across the globe, particularly to developing countries. Most countries in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, depend on capital inflows to sustain economic growth and development. Capital flows come in different forms, and may be unstable, and sometimes volatile. The foreign direct investment component of capital flows is considered to be relatively more stable than other components. The foreign portfolio investment component, on the other hand, is more liquid and unstable, due to its high responsiveness towards unfavourable economic conditions. Its impact on economic growth is, therefore, favourable in the short-run, but could turn out to be largely unfavourable in the long-run, due to its volatility [40]. The other components are more stable, and characterized by less volatility. Generally, capital flow is important to developing countries, due to the wide resource gap that tends to slow economic growth and development. Domestic resources are grossly inadequate to facilitate rapid economic growth. This is probably the main reason behind the tendency of some developing countries to accumulate exceedingly high levels of external debt. Over the last two decades, there has been a tremendous progress in the adoption of advanced IT in developing countries, which has accounted in no small measure, for the increasing trend of capital inflows with positive impact on growth and development. The capital inflows have also been greatly encouraged by the political and economic reforms that took place in most of the countries, which created conducive environment for advanced countries to supply more resources to underdeveloped countries. The countries, with such conducive environment, have so far succeeded in attracting more foreign direct investment, foreign portfolio investment, foreign loans, and foreign development aid. The political and economic reforms undertaken in these countries thus made them major recipients of capital flows. However, the increasing role of IT in global capital flows seems to have attracted more interest and attention of researchers in recent times. In previous research on this issue, the rush to package the relationship between IT and capital flows left some vital aspects unattended. These studies investigated only the direct effect of IT on capital flows, ignoring the fact that IT has more elaborate effects on capital flows. This is an important gap that needs to be filled, in order to make estimation results more relevant to policy making. Furthermore, the components of capital flows deserve investigation to ascertain the level of asymmetric effects generated by IT. The need to conduct further research on the issue, at this time, cannot be overemphasized, bearing in mind that IT can impact capital flows and the components in a more elaborate form (directly, indirectly and asymmetrically). The direct impact is transmitted straight from IT to capital flows. On the other hand, indirect effects pass through variables such as rate of return on capital, exchange rate, financial innovation, and size of the private sector. These are variables that are closely linked to IT, and also help to multiply its effect on capital flows. Again, IT can impact asymmetrically by generating uneven effects on aggregate capital flows and the various components (foreign direct investment, foreign portfolio investment, foreign debt flows, and official development aid). This study, therefore, attempts to estimate the correlative effects (direct and indirect) and asymmetric effects of IT on capital flows and the various components. This is done by building and estimating an appropriate model that has the capacity to capture the direct, indirect and asymmetric effects. The investigation is expected to fill the perceived gap in literature, and significantly contribute to the existing body of knowledge concerning IT and capital flows. The study employs the techniques of the general method of moments (GMM) to evaluate the various effects of IT on capital flows. In terms of scope, the study covers the ten most technologically advanced countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The countries, according to the world ranking, are South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritius, Ghana, Rwanda, Botswana, Angola, Uganda, and Zimbabwe [26]. The period of study is 1996-2019, as data on IT were unavailable before 1996. The remaining sections of this study comprise a literature review, descriptive analysis of IT and capital flows, model specification, estimation techniques, estimations and analysis of results, policy recommendations, and conclusion.",

As standard general equilibrium models assuming perfect information yield competitive equilibria with competing producers/sellers setting identical prices, researchers have come up with approaches which are able to reproduce price dispersion as an equilibrium phenomenon [36]. The two main lines in this respect are either suggesting the extension of the standard monopolistic competition model or the use of a search-theoretic approach [10]. Along the first line, we can find heterogeneous marginal costs as the most trivial solution but also heterogeneous demand elasticities resulting from heterogeneous visiting costs [40]. The second line emphasizes that there is some incompleteness in price information on the side of consumers which is assumed to arise from positive search costs (see e.g. [11] for a comprehensive review of this literature). In this paper, we join to this vein of literature, but take an approach to consumer search and price heterogeneity from the viewpoint of complex systems. Instead of starting from a detailed account of how consumers are limited in attaining complete information, we rather take the structure of information flows as given and view this structure as a complex system of market interactions between producers/suppliers and consumers/buyers. As a result, we are able to infer on how the structure of the network connecting market actors shape price heterogeneity. Our approach from the side of complex systems is also supported by recent work which argues that the analysis of increasingly complex economic systems requires the integration of aspects and methods from the toolbox of complex system research [23, 24]. On the other hand, the results of network science indicate that the aggregate performance of a system is inherently related to the structure of connections among agents in the system (see e.g. [7, 16, 28, 34]). Several contributions have recently shown how economic micro-structure affects aggregate performance. Acemoglu et al. [2] and [1] e.g. demonstrate that the asymmetric distribution of intersectoral transactions can lead to heavy-tailed aggregate fluctuations. Other papers show that accounting for the structure of connections between market actors can significantly change predictions from standard economic models [5, 37, 38]. Further studies focus on connections between financial institutions and reveal that the structure of these connections contribute to systemic risk [3, 4, 19]. Some other studies have explicitly taken into account the relationship between network structure or network formation and the pricing behavior of firms. However, these contributions typically refer to network externalities where the connection structure is assumed to play a role between consumers [8, 30, 31, 33], to situations where firms can engage in some kind of information exchange [12] or markets where networks (like telecommunication networks) compete with each other [27]. Some of these contributions assume targeted pricing (price discrimination) on the side of producers, where consumer-specific pricing depends on the level of influence a given consumer has on others [21, 22], while network structure among consumers is taken into account in these papers. Other studies, like the authors in [43], have focused on pricing in supply chain networks, where the structure of interaction among production sites is explicit, but modeling the demand from outside the supply network remains limited. A relatively recent line of research focuses on network externalities from a structural perspective. These contributions explicitly consider the structure of network connections among consumers (local network externalities) and present how specific connection structures affect pricing behavior and may lead to market segmentation [6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 29]. A similar approach is followed by [41], who introduce explicit network structures among productive subsidiaries of decision making firms with strategic substitutability among the products of the subsidiaries. However, there is no attempt up to our knowledge which examines the role of explicit network structures between buyers and sellers, and how this structure affects price dispersion. Although by taking a different perspective, our model is a close relative to search-cost models, like [39] or [17], where consumers are not perfectly informed about all prices on the market. We introduce a specific version of a standard model of monopolistic competition with finite actors, where the interaction network among market actors is given explicitly and this network represents the biased information flows on the market. In this sense, this paper assumes some sort of biased information flows, represented by a specific network structure, and then continues to analyze the role of this structure in shaping price dispersion. This is in contrast with the standard approach where consumers are assumed to be aware of the true price index as made up of all prices in the market. Instead, our more realistic extension assumes that this information basis is selective and consumer-specific, which producers take into account when making their decisions. From a methodological point of view, our approach is similar to [42] and [41]: instead of assuming a given network structure, we also derive an existence condition without a fixed structure and then analyze the effect of some specific network arrangements using network models. Also, our approach builds on that of [38] by using the standard symmetric monopolistic competition model and develop it in a way that explicit supplier and buyer relationships are taken into account. The contribution of our paper with respect to these closely related papers is twofold. First, we analyze the explicit connection structure between suppliers and buyers while previous papers focused on network externalities between consumers (demand side) of given firm or subsidiaries (supply side). Thus, our results contribute to previous research by pointing to the effects of the connection structure between the supply and demand side. Second, it releases the implicit symmetry- and representativity condition used in [38] by allowing for arbitrary network structures within the same model framework of monopolistic competition. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we construct the model of optimal pricing, with an incomplete market interaction structure. The following section then derives the condition under which optimal pricing is possible and economically feasible. Then, a separate section is devoted to the analysis of the optimal price distribution under different assumptions about the structure of the market interaction network. First, we consider a complete network as a baseline case and then explore the properties of the price distribution if the network structure is symmetric (Erdős–Rényi type) and if it is asymmetric. We conclude the paper with a summary of the main results and pointing out some areas for further research.",

Current data indicate that despite the strong progress in Internet penetration from 6% in 2000 to nearly 51% in 2019 [15], a growing gap exists between the adoption rates of rich and poor populations regardless of the ICT price basket monitored [16]. This condition has resulted in “a half of the people with 4G network coverage remain offline, mainly due to high costs of Internet access”. Previous experiences, for instance, of those in rural settings, recognize the necessity of a solid economic framework to balance the social goal of offering services to the poorest and the practical need for incentives for operators to provide services. Many studies, such as [4, 5, 18, 29], have shown that auctions are efficient mechanisms for dynamic resource allocation, particularly for selling bandwidth. Their promising results are partially explained because they can handle uncertainty, such as estimations of user demand functions, and dynamically control allocation through competition between users. Nevertheless, in scenarios where mixed buying-capacity users compete and tight resource constraints are common, it is expected that resources may only be allocated to users with higher budgets. To counteract this problem, the field of economics has started to study the benefits of subsidized and set-aside auctions for government procurement [2, 13, 25]. These mechanisms have previously been used to spread allocations favoring selected groups, such as small companies. In subsidy auction schemes, a selected group is granted a proportionally higher bid, such that members (i.e., low-budget users) can compete with those in nontargeted groups (i.e., high-budget users). In set-aside auction schemes, resources are preassigned to groups to ensure a minimal, guaranteed allocation within the group, while group members still compete with each other. Nevertheless, subsidy auction schemes include a number of pitfalls for selling bandwidth. First, it is not clear who is in charge of funding subsidies; second, to have a positive effect, the actual subsidy has to be set, which generally requires a previous study; third, the allocation of units to low-budget groups is not guaranteed; and fourth, this type of auction does not solve the problem of determining users who should be granted the subsidy. Set-aside schemes suffer almost the same problems, but their design offers an allocation guarantee. The adoption of a set-aside mechanism is complex in practice. Users cannot be easily clustered as belonging to a favored group, and higher budget users have the rational best response of adopting a lower budget role as lower prices are expected. Our work presents a pricing model that is oriented to reach the social goal of providing network access to all while simultaneously addressing these practical challenges. Our pricing strategy introduces a self-selection of users based on budget constraints, enabled by new networking technologies. Specifically, our contributions, sorted by importance, are as follows: 
 We present a social-goal-oriented auction mechanism that incentivizes users to reveal private information by providing rewards or assigning penalties, and thereby, reducing the probability of receiving allocated units. We present and discuss the trade-off of our auction mechanism between the increased network coverage of low-budget users and the decrease of operator’s income. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a research overview in auction methods for bandwidth allocation as well as the similarities and differences between our approach and previous methods. Next, we present the target network deployment scenario and its main elements. In Section 4, we explain the proposed auction mechanism, starting with a simple auction of two units and three users and then generalize the auction to many users and quantities. In Section 5, we present an alternative to calculate the Nash equilibrium in an actual setting where many users are competing. In Section 6, we discuss the auction setup, introduce other mechanisms implemented for benchmarking, and explain the scenarios used for the simulations. Section 7 presents results that compare our proposed mechanism with other coverage-oriented mechanisms. Finally, Section 8 concludes this paper.",
