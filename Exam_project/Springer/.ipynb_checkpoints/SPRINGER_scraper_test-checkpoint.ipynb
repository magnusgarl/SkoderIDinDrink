      "History abounds with episodes of forced migration triggered by civil unrest, wars, natural disasters, and state mandated expulsions or relocations. If current times are any indication, we will continue to witness similar events going forward. Forced migration may yield qualitatively different consequences for stayers, migrants, and destination regions. Yet, the literature so far has largely focused on the impact of forced migration on receiving populations (e.g., Hornung, (2014)) or migrants themselves (e.g., Becker et al., (2020)), while paying less attention to the long-term prosperity of sending regions.Footnote 1 How sending regions fare in the long run depends on both the adverse effects of forced out-migrations and how departing populations had shaped the development potential of local economies until they left. These latter effects—the economic legacy of émigrés—may operate through human capital spillovers from departing groups onto the staying population and the productive assets these groups accumulated until departure. Ultimately, the characteristics of departing groups (e.g. education, occupational skills, tangible assets relative to stayers) and the nature of social and economic interactions between departing and staying groups will dictate the economic legacy of émigrés. However, disentangling the legacy of departing groups from the contemporaneous influence of their remaining members and the potential endogeneity of migration is a challenge. We examine the economic footprints of the two largest non-Muslim communities in the Ottoman Empire, i.e. Armenians and Greeks, almost a century after their wholesale removal from their homelands within modern Turkey. Our goal is to study whether the positive legacy effects of these high-skilled groups are sufficiently strong –against the backdrop of the potentially adverse impact of the expulsions themselves– so as to impart a lasting imprint on spatial patterns of economic development. This is a novel departure from the literature examining the lasting impact of human capital and the cultural and institutional heritage migrant communities bring to the locations they settle. This paper, instead, studies the legacy of these groups on the subsequent economic development of the locations they departed. Armenian and Greek communities of Anatolia historically possessed higher levels of human capital and wealth relative to Muslim groups (Üngör & Polatel, 2011; Der Matossian, 2007; Kévorkian, 2011). Particularly over the 18th and 19th centuries, when trade between the Middle East and Western Europe was soaring, the economic standing of the non-Muslim minorities of the Empire significantly improved vis-a-vis the Muslim communities as the former came to dominate trade and commerce (Kuran, 2004). Two events at the turn of the 20th century marked the end of centuries-long religious coexistence. Ottoman Armenians were subjected to mass killings and deportations (also known as the Armenian Genocide) during the First World War, while the Greeks were forced out of Asia Minor following the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 and the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. These tragic episodes provide us with two unique experiments of history that are well suited to empirically assess the long-run legacy of productive minorities on regional development, in general, and on local human capital, in particular. Measuring the economic legacy of departing groups is challenging. Regional differences in the timing of outmigration, the possibility of return migration, and the role of economic choices pose difficulties. Our historical setting is largely immune to these problems. Both Greeks and Armenians were forced to leave their homelands as a result of the official state policies that were motivated by the ongoing wars and the ideological orientation of the ruling elite. The mass expulsions of Armenians and Greeks led to an almost complete removal of these communities over a short time period.Footnote 2 The timing of expulsions almost a century ago allows us a reasonably long window of time to assess the persistence of minority legacy. Therefore, we exploit sub-national variation in Armenian and Greek population shares in the late Ottoman period as a proxy for historical exposure of each region to minority presence, without having to worry about contemporary spillovers across regions.Footnote 3 We find that districts with greater Armenian and Greek concentration before the expulsions are today (i) more densely populated, (ii) more urbanized, and (iii) exhibit greater economic activity measured by light density at night. Estimates suggest 11 and 14 percent higher income per capita in response to a move from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the Armenian and Greek population share distributions, respectively. A rich battery of robustness checks and complementary evidence at a more granular geographic level suggest that the relationships we document likely reflect a causal minority legacy. First, our baseline results are robust to potential geographic and climatic determinants of early economic activity that might have influenced historical settlement patterns. Also, our estimates are not sensitive to various drivers of historical and contemporary development. For example, minority presence exerts a sizable influence on regional development independently of (i) historical market access (e.g. proximity to historical railroads, trade routes or major ports), (ii) Muslim immigrants from Greece who came to Turkey as part of the population exchange, (iii) exposure to war, and (iv) density of neolithic sites and ancient settlements as a proxy for prehistoric conditions favorable to agriculture and amenable to permanent settlement. To more flexibly account for selection on observables, we employ matching estimators and find results that are qualitatively similar to the OLS analysis. We also verify that selection on unobservables is unlikely to explain away our estimates (Altonji et al., 2005; Oster, 2019). Lastly, we verify that spatial correlation does not drive our results.Footnote 4 Second, we zoom into the level of villages and neighborhoods in Turkey to offer micro-level evidence. We find that nighttime light density today is remarkably higher in localities with Armenian and Greek community buildings –a proxy for historical minority presence in the absence of demographic data at a granular level. Estimates remain significant and sizable accounting for likely confounders and district level fixed effects. Importantly, accounting for district fixed effects brings us closer to a causal interpretation as we exploit variation across very close localities that are highly similar in unobserved geographic, cultural and institutional characteristics. Thus, omitted factors are very unlikely to confound the causal relationship between minority presence and luminosity. Lastly, to take into account historical agglomeration that is not driven by minority presence per se, we also account for proximity to old Muslim community buildings and find similar results. We argue that an important source of minority legacy was inter-group human capital spillovers during the long co-existence of Muslim and non-Muslim communities. In support of this mechanism, we first provide historical evidence that Ottoman Armenians and Greeks were on average more educated than their Muslim counterparts and constituted a disproportionately high share of the skilled labor force. Moreover, already before the expulsions, Muslims in high minority regions were relatively more educated than other Muslim groups. In the immediate aftermath of the mass expulsions, regions that were previously home to minorities still had higher literacy rates among remaining Muslims than low-minority regions, and a greater share of the Muslims in these regions were employed in commerce. We then demonstrate that today there are still significant gaps in educational attainment between high and low-minority districts. Baseline estimates suggest that a 20 percent increase in either historical Armenian or Greek share implies 2.1 percentage points higher current high school completion rates. This change amounts to more than 12.5 percent of the mean completion rate of 16 percent. However, this effect of historical minority presence diminishes significantly once more direct proxies for exposure to minority human capital –such as the proximity to minority school buildings or historical literacy rates among the Muslim population– are accounted for. We also show that proximity to old minority school buildings predicts higher luminosity even conditional on other types of community buildings. Finally, consistently with the human capital spillover channel, we document continuity in occupational patterns. Using novel historical micro data on religious identity and occupation for the entire universe of male residents in three Anatolian cities around 1840s, we show that Armenians and Greeks were indeed over-represented in relatively more skill-intensive occupation groups, and that religious diversity within some of these occupation groups was particularly high –suggesting ample scope for inter-group economic interactions and knowledge and skill transfer. Then, drawing on the 2000 Census micro data, we confirm that many of the same occupation groups where minorities tended to specialize constitute a higher share of the labor force today in ex-minority regions. As an additional channel of persistence, we assess the potential role of minority assets and the way they were redistributed among the Muslim population in the aftermath of the expulsions. We offer suggestive evidence that redistribution of confiscated minority assets among Muslim groups contributed to wealth concentration in the long run. In particular, we show that, conditional on geography and minority population shares, contemporary land inequality is positively related to the presence of community buildings built by Armenians. This finding is in line with the anecdotal evidence that the main beneficiaries of “abandoned” Armenian properties were members of local Muslim elite. Greek property, instead, was relatively less subject to asset grabbing by local elite than Armenian property, and historically Greek areas received larger flows of Muslim immigrants. Accordingly, we find that modern land inequality is not related to historical Greek buildings. It is possible that concentration of land and wealth facilitated business formation particularly during the early stages of Turkish economic development despite its adverse effects on human capital accumulation.Footnote 5 Taken together, our findings bear significance beyond their particular context. They imply that, in regions with mass population replacements, the legacy of past population geography can be an important confounder. In particular, not only the ancestral heritage of current populations, but also the economic influence of long-gone groups can leave a strong imprint on spatial patterns of economic development. Therefore, when evaluating the role of ancestral origins in comparative development, one needs to better account for the history of past populations that are long gone. The exodus of Greeks and Armenians permanently altered the composition of embodied traits in the remaining populations. This major shock might have reduced the future economic potential of the sending regions not only vis-a-vis their own counterfactual trajectories but also vis-a-vis the other regions that were not directly affected by the expulsions. Yet, we find that regions that were treated with historical minority presence fared better in the post-expulsion period compared to areas without significant Greek or Armenian presence. Thus, our first novel contribution is to demonstrate that the positive historical legacy of high-skilled groups can trump any negative effect these regions might have experienced. Related literature highlights the effects of expulsions and persecutions on social structure, labor market outcomes and education (Acemoglu et al., 2011; Becker et al., 2020; Testa, 2021; Bharadwaj et al., 2015), agricultural productivity (Bazzi et al., 2016; Bharadwaj & Mirza, 2019), population dynamics (Chaney & Hornbeck, 2016), firm performance (Huber et al., 2021), financial development (Pascali, 2016), and scientific productivity (Waldinger, 2012, 2016; Akbulut-Yuksel & Yuksel, 2015). We depart from this literature as we are not concerned with isolating the effects of expulsions per se. Despite the possible negative effect of the expulsion of Armenians and Greeks on productivity, we argue that their centuries-long presence and co-existence with Muslim groups have positively transformed the development potential in these regions. Within the context of the long-term legacy of inter-religious co-existence, our work is related to Grosfeld et al. (2013), who show that current non-Jewish residents of the Pale of Settlement exhibit higher anti-market attitudes and within-group trust, and lower entrepreneurship. They argue that the negative legacy of the forced co-existence of Jews and Christians was partly a byproduct of the anti-Jewish culture. In contrast, we find a positive legacy of unforced co-existence of Greeks and Armenians with their Muslim neighbors. The difference might be attributed to the involuntary nature of co-habitation in the Pale of Settlement, greater social and occupational segregation between Jews and Christians, and, possibly, stronger ethnic animosity towards Jews. After all, there is evidence that Jewish presence in pre-industrial Europe facilitated urban development where peaceful co-existence was achieved (Johnson and Koyama, 2017), religious tolerance was a catalyst for innovation during the second industrial revolution in Prussia (Cinnirella & Streb, 2017), and complementarities between diverse ethno-religious groups can foster innovation and economic activity (Ashraf & Galor, 2013; Hornung, 2019). Second, we argue that the positive net legacy effect persisted largely due to the pre-departure influence of Armenian and Greek communities on human capital accumulation among Muslims. This connects our paper to the literature on the importance of human capital spillovers for development (Waldinger, 2010, 2012), and, in particular, the socioeconomic influence of high-skilled ethno-religious groups (Becker & Woessmann, 2009; Hornung, 2014; Moser et al., 2014; Johnson & Koyama, 2017; Natkhov and Vasilenok, 2021). Our paper differs from this literature in its focus on whether the legacy effects persist in the absence of minority human capital, rather than capturing a combination of accumulated historical effects and the contemporaneous influence of human capital embodied in these groups. Third, we add to the literature on the importance of human capital by studying the legacy of two communities that have received little attention –Greeks and Armenians of the Ottoman Empire. As an exception, Sakalli (2019) shows that the gains in educational attainment after the secularization of the Turkish education system in the early 1920s have been smaller in Turkish provinces with higher religiosity (proxied by Armenian population share). Both papers use Armenian share as an explanatory variable but for different purposes. We study the long-term legacy of minorities on development, while Sakalli (2019) focuses on the differential effect of an educational reform in areas with higher historical Armenian presence. Also, Grosjean (2011) shows that locations in South Eastern Europe with greater non-Muslim presence have relatively higher bank penetration today. Our paper also relates to the work on historical path dependence. Most studies in this literature evaluate whether historical accidents and temporary shocks to population size, human capital and other productive assets can permanently change economic geography (O’Rourke, 1994; Davis & Weinstein, 2002; Nunn, 2008; Miguel & Roland, 2011; Bleakley & Lin, 2012; Jedwab et al., 2019). Our results suggest path-dependence in development driven by the legacy of highly skilled minority groups even though their economic ascent was interrupted by mass expulsions. Lastly, we contribute to our understanding of the regional disparities in Turkish economic development (Altuğ et al., 2008; Pamuk, 1987; Toprak, 2012). For example, Asik et al. (2020) document the West-East divide in Turkey and the inverse-U shaped pattern in regional economic inequality since 1880. We show that the legacy of Armenian and Greek populations is not only an important contributor to the evolution of inter-regional disparities but it also explains variations at a more local level.\n",
