"1. IntroductionA Potential Pareto Public Good (PPPG) creates an aggregate net benefit to society while harming some of the involved participants in the process (Dekel et al., 2017). Examples include waste treatment facilities (e.g., incinerators or disposals), prisons, and wind turbines (Meyerhoff et al., 2010,Zerrahn, 2017). The collective provision of a PPPG is convoluted and has two dimensions: where to build the project, what we call thesitingproblem; and how large the PPPG would be, what we call thesizingproblem. Since larger projects may be more efficient but cause greater harm, making the compensation attractive to the host who can provide the most extensive public good is fundamental to reaching its Pareto potential.The literature has separately tackled the siting and sizing problems. One strand has proposed mechanisms that select the host of the PPPG and grant a compensation that ensures voluntary participation (Minehart and Neeman, 2002,Sakai, 2012). They address a “not in my backyard”–NIMBY–or “locally unwanted land use”–LULU–situation, acronyms revealing the emphasis on thesitingproblem (Popper, 1983,Schively, 2007). The other strand, addressing thesizingproblem, has focused on incentive-compatible mechanisms that guarantee the efficient provision of public goods, often with personalizedtaxesreflecting the intensity in the valuation of the public project (Chen, 2002,Van Essen and Walker, 2017).We aim to solve together the siting and sizing problems by proposing a mechanism that simultaneously selects a “suitable” host for the PPPG and the optimal size embedded in a Lindahl allocation, defined as an efficient allocation with a set of prices reflecting a burden-sharing agreement (Buchholz and Peters, 2007). Embedding the two problems within our mechanism has three advantages derived from the relationship between project size and the required host’s compensation. First, marginal costs and benefits become central in the normative analysis of PPPG provision. Thus, marginal changes in the size-dependent compensation are more informative about welfare considerations compared to analysis based on binary provision decisions. Second, the collective decision on project size alleviates the NIMBY’s popular resistance because the mechanism embeds elements to curb project size. Third, an endogenous project size allows conceiving this problem in terms of optimally installed capacities, improving future planning and reducing the required facilities.Solving the two problems together is non-trivial. If the host selection criteria combine suitability and public good size, mechanisms tackling thesitingproblem may lose their truthful revelation properties because potential hosts may distort their messages to avoid the local harm. Solutions in this direction select the host first and, in a further stage, the other communities determine the size-dependent compensation (Laurent-Lucchetti and Leroux, 2011). Nonetheless, such informational requirements are equivalent to knowingex antewho the most suitable host is. On the other hand, mechanisms tackling thesizingproblem may not induce voluntary participation if prices follow a Clarke tax rule (e.g., the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism). Prices based on the caused externality discourage potential hosts because removing their negative utility from the welfare computations would have yielded larger facilities.In our mechanism, each community submits a four-dimensional message. Three components interplay in a market-like fashion: a desired size (or quantity) of the facility, a requested price per unit for being the host, and a paid price per unit for being a non-host community. The fourth component, a bid, allows communities to compete to become the host in a modified second-price auction. The market-like components generate Lindahl allocations in equilibrium: the efficient quantity is attained by charging each community a price proportional to its marginal benefit from this provision (called a Lindahl tax), granting that the total payments are enough tofinancethe public good. The host’s Lindahl tax is negative and reflects the compensation, or earnings, from hosting the facility. If the sum of prices per unit of non-host communities is sufficient to cover the price requested by the host and the building cost per unit, the facility is implemented, and its size is defined by the geometric average of all the desired quantities. An equilibrium with project implementation implies that: (i) each community submits its Lindahl tax, and the total payment matches the total cost and compensation; (ii) the outcome quantity islocallyoptimal for each community.The market-like part of the mechanism does not guarantee a globally optimal allocation because we can have as many Lindahl allocations as communities involved. Communities may be better off as the host, relative to being a non-host, due to the financial compensation in the former role. Moreover, host selection based on prices will create strategic incentives to overstate the willingness to host the facility. Communities interested in taking this role would compete à la Bertrand, and the winner would select a size above its optimal adjusted by a lower compensation per unit of the facility.The auction-like component in our mechanism addresses the “role strategic uncertainty” (i.e., whether a community that benefits from being the host should behave like one) and induces the selection of the globally optimal Lindahl allocation. Each community announces a bid they are willing to pay to become the host. The highest bidder is selected and pays the second-highest bid. This payment acts as a selection device: a community that bears the lower cost of hosting the facility has, after receiving the Lindahl tax, the higher net benefit of being the host and, therefore, the highest willingness to pay for this role. As in standard second-price auctions, truthful bidding (given the other communities’ strategies) leads to an efficient allocation even if each community’s preferences remainprivate information: no community can profit by misreporting the gains from becoming the host.The dual approach of our mechanism reveals that efficient sizing is alocalproperty and efficient siting is aglobalproperty. Besides, our mechanism differs from the existing ones in two features. First, whereas former mechanisms conceive the transfer as a compensation (Kunreuther et al., 1987,O’Sullivan, 1993,Kleindorfer and Sertel, 1994,Minehart and Neeman, 2002), our auction-like component induces competition among communities to become the “seller” in the market-like component of our mechanism. Second, most previous mechanisms sacrifice efficient host selection to maintain budget balance. We took the opposite direction because the payment made by the host is only positive when there is some contestability for the hosting role. Hence, our auction-like component preserves budget balancedness as long as there is a single community willing to host.Our model abstains from two aspects. First, unlikeWaehrer (2003)andAmbec and Kervinio (2016), we do not considerspatial effectsand implicitly assume that the facility’s costs are encapsulated in the hosting community. Abandoning this assumption will increase the complexity of our mechanism because having more than two types (due to buyers’ proximity) would increase the message’s submitted prices. Second, we abstain from discussing the aggregation of preferences within a community. That is, we do not consider the individual incentives behind the delegation process of the community’s decision.",Eduardo,César,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 225, September 2023, 104953",0

"1. IntroductionFirms respond to increased labor costs through both employment and non-employment margins. They may reduce their workforce, adopt new labor-saving technologies, increase work intensity, or relocate their business. These diverse adjustment mechanisms make it difficult to fully understand the consequences of a policy that raises firms’ labor costs. Even well-intended policies can result in unintended adverse outcomes for target recipients.In this study, we examine unintended consequences of the minimum wage policy in South Korea. Employers are required to contribute a fixed percentage of employees’ earnings towards social insurance, such as health insurance, retirement pensions, unemployment insurance, and disability insurance.1The contribution amount is proportional to earnings, averaging 8 percent of total earnings during the sample period from 2011 to 2019.2On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage compels firms to raise hourly wages for employees whose current wages are below the new minimum wage. This may lead to an increase in total earnings and subsequently a higher mandated social insurance contribution. However, it is important to note that workers employed for less than 60 h per month are exempt from mandated contributions. As a result, raising the minimum wage incentivizes firms to take greater advantage of exempt workers, potentially leading to declines in social insurance coverage.Both the minimum wage and social insurance mandate are policies that are widespread in many countries, but there has been limited research on their interaction effects. A social insurance mandate shifts the labor demand curve downward by the amount that employers must pay. At the same time, unlike in the standard case of tax incidence, the labor supply curve is also shifted downwardly by the extent to which employees value social insurance coverage (Summers, 1989).Gruber (1994)showed that when a particular non-wage benefit, such asmaternity benefits, is mandated, a significant portion of its cost is shifted to targeted workers, reducing the negative employment effects of the social insurance mandate. However, this equilibrium adjustment does not occur if wages are downward rigid due to a minimum wage. In such cases, mandating non-wage benefits likely decrease employment, and this negative effect is likely exacerbated if the contribution amount is proportional to earnings.We examine how firms respond to increased labor costs resulting from a minimum wage increase in the presence of a social insurance mandate.3We focus on “under-60” workers: those who work less than 60 h per month and are therefore exempt from employer-mandated contributions. This exemption rule creates a discontinuity in total labor costs per hour at the work hour cutoff.We leverage this discontinuity for a sharp identification of treatment effects. We estimate the effect of a minimum wage increase on the distribution of monthly hours worked. Specifically, we divide hours worked into five-hour bins (e.g., 55–59 and 60–64) and estimate the effect of a minimum wage increase on the share of workers in each bin. We use these estimates to examine whether raising the minimum wage increases the share of under-60 workers and whether this effect is discontinuous at the cutoff hour. Since there are no other policies to use 60 as the cutoff hour than the employer-mandated contribution towards social insurance, we can be sure that the discontinuity in minimum wage effects is the joint consequence of the minimum wage and the social insurance mandate.To identify the causal effects of higher labor costs on the distribution of monthly hours worked, we utilize temporal variation in whether the national minimum wage is binding within exogenously defined groups of workers. Our baseline analysis groups workers by gender, age, education, and industry. For each group, we compute the fraction of “bound” workers whose hourly wage is greater than or equal to the current minimum wage but lower than the new minimum wage (Card, 1992,Machin et al., 2003,Draca et al., 2011,Clemens, 2016,Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019,Jardim and Van Inwegen, 2019,Kabátek, 2021). The fraction of bound workers varies not only across groups but also across years within a group, depending on group-specific wage distribution and the magnitude of increase in the minimum wage.Variations in the fraction of bound workers may reflect group-specific changes in wage distribution over years, for instance, by business cycle. This is a reasonable criticism, since the business-cycle effect is heterogeneous across demographic groups (Bitler and Hoynes, 2015). We check whether our measure solely captures the impact of the minimum wage by separately controlling for the proportions of low-wage workers paid slightly above the minimum wage. This is a feasible robustness check since our payroll data precisely measure earnings and hours worked. Our payroll data consist of individual records for 10 million employees at 30,000 establishments, which were collected by the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL). The data are repeated cross-sections that are representative of non-public establishments with one or more employee. In addition to this robustness check, we additionally validate our results by exploiting unanticipated hikes of the minimum wage during 2018 and 2019. The minimum wage increased by around 30 percent during this period, which was much larger in magnitude compared to increases in prior years. We show that our results are robust when focusing on this particular episode.We find that the share of under-60 workers increases after a rise in the minimum wage. Comparing the effects of the minimum wage over the distribution of hours worked, we find that the effects are discontinuous and drop to zero exactly at the cutoff hour, 60. Note that we do not impose any restriction that could differently treat two groups of workers above and below the cutoff. Thus, the discontinuity in estimates for the minimum wage effect at the cutoff hour is found in the data without any parametric restrictions. Given that there is no confounding factor related to the cutoff hour, our findings support that the minimum wage and social insurance mandate jointly increase the share of short-time workers below 60 h. Although the share of under-60 workers is comparatively small, 3.9 percent in our data, our results show that changing hours worked can be another non-employment margin of adjustment to a cost shock. A couple of additional findings further bolster our conclusion. First, we do not find the same results prior to 2011, when working at least 60 h per month was not the eligibility condition for employer-mandated contributions. Second, we find that our findings are robust to controlling for the proportions of low-wage workers.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section2reviews the literature related to our study. In Section3, we introduce the data and institutional background of the social insurance system. We also explain the minimum wage in Korea and document recent trends of short-time workers. In Section4, we explain our estimation model and identification assumptions. We also explain how we construct group-level panel data. Section5presents results and robustness checks. Section6concludes the paper.",Ji,Jungmin,Kyungho,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 225, September 2023, 104951",0
