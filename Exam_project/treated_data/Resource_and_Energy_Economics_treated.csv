"1. IntroductionPolitical connections are of great interest for a firm that seeks an advantageous position among its competitors (Lin et al., 2011,Cingano and Pinotti, 2013,Feng et al., 2014). There has been a rich literature focusing on value added to politically connected firms (Chang and Wong, 2004,Faccio, 2006,Li et al., 2008,Goldman et al., 2009,Bourveau et al., 2016,Schoenherr, 2019). In addition to various preferential treatments involving resource allocation (Fisman, 2001,Cingano and Pinotti, 2013,Titl et al., 2021,Balán et al., 2022), other channels through which a firm’s political connection pays off may be less visible. These include relaxed regulatory oversight, avoidance of compliance measures, and many other channels (Niessen and Ruenzi, 2010,Duchin and Sosyura, 2012,Bourveau et al., 2016,Deng et al., 2019). However, a firm’s pursuit of benefits from political connection may result in enormous social costs, which sometimes might even trigger increased loss of life (Fisman and Wang, 2015,Jia and Nie, 2017). This study explores a new dimension of the negative social impacts of political connections through investigating pollution emissions from politically connected firms. Arguably, in an institutional setting that employs political centralization and fiscal decentralization, local legislators are more tolerant of excess pollution since it implies a boost to the economy. This claim is especially valid for government officials in China during the period when their chance of promotion hinges heavily on the growth of the economy (Jia, 2017).This paper studies a sample of 689 listed firms during 1999–2010 to estimate the impact of political connectedness on listed firms’ pollution emissions in China. Our main finding suggests that firms with political connections are likely to gain regulatory protection from local governments and thus discharge more pollutants than their counterparts do. Specifically, we find that, ceteris paribus, a polluting firm with political connections would emit on average 25% more Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)1per 10,000 RMB worth of total output. We define a listed firm as politically connected if its top managers (i.e., chairman and/or CEO) used to hold or currently hold a position in the government, National People’s Congress (NPC), and/or Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) during a certain period of the study timeframe. We exploit variations in the turnover of top managers with political connections within firms and across time to identify the empirical relationship between political connection and firms’ pollution emissions. Our estimations remain robust when we further include linear temporal trends at both the provincial and industrial levels. We further employ an event study approach to examine how the impact of political connections evolves over time.The primary concern regarding our identification strategy is that the matches of top managers with political connections and polluting firms are not random. A firm that anticipates more pollution emissions in the future may intentionally search for top managers with political connections. Though unbalanced, the extended length of our dataset allows us to observe multiple incidents of turnover of top managers within many firms, which offers additional variation in treatment status within a firm to identify the association between political connections and pollution emissions. We utilize a subsample of firms that have political connections over the course of consecutive years to study how the impacts of political connections evolve over time. The results indicate that the effect of political connections on pollution emissions may not be discernible initially and exhibits a rising trend from the second year of connected managers’ arrival. However, it remains insignificant until five to six years after connected top managers join the firm. This result deviates from the assumption that political connectedness confers an immediate impact (Khwaja and Mian, 2005,Duchin and Sosyura, 2012,Lehne et al., 2018), and partially alleviates the concern that politically connected managers join a firm that has prepared to increase its emission levels.To further validate the plausible exogenous impact of political connectedness, we add additional flexibility to the model by including identifiers for the initial few years right after connected top managers leave firms. We find that the impact of political connections on pollution emissions lingers one year after connected top managers are no longer in their positions, and the effect fades out thereafter. Adding identifiers for these lingering effects increases the estimate of the impact of the political connections by about ten percentage points. Those results support the thesis that polluting firms may enjoy the value of political connectedness for an extended period due to the mutual benefits for firms and local legislators who expect enhanced economic growth.In addition to COD, we also test the impact of political connectedness on firms’ emissions of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the other two critical industrial pollutants. However, we do not find a significant increase in those two pollutants when connected top managers join the firm. We provide two explanations for these results. First, ammonia nitrogen was not included in the national binding targets of pollution reduction during our study period. The impact of weakened regulatory oversight on a unregulated pollutant is therefore muted. Second, in contrast to water pollution, the damage and disamenity caused by air pollution are more visible to the public, which leads to reduced incentives for both connected firms and local regulators to build up channels for compliance avoidance.Our dataset contains detailed information on the political connectedness of listed firms’ top managers, including previous work locations, as well as class and type of governmental positions. We further explore the heterogeneous effects of political connections. In general, we find that the impacts of political connections on COD discharge are more pronounced for firms employing top managers who have previously worked in local government. We find similar results on firms with politically connected top managers who used to work in the same city (or province). We also show that our results remain robust when environmental policies become stringent and local officials have strong incentives to dampen pollution levels.An alternative explanation for our main finding is that unobserved managerial attributes and talents of connected top managers account for improved production, thereby resulting in elevated pollution discharges. To address this concern, we further test the impact of political connection on firms’ annual gross output, annual wastewater emissions, and the number of wastewater treatment facilities. We fail to find evidence for changes in firms’ production capacity and wastewater treatment capacity after connected top managers join. This set of results plausibly suggests a possible channel through which firms enjoy the value of political connections: Polluting firms choose to leave treatment units idle, lessening treatment costs but bringing about elevated pollution emissions. We argue that the direct value of political connectedness for a polluting firm is in reduced abatement costs due to weakened regulatory enforcement, which eventually results in increased environmental and social costs.Overall, this paper contributes to the literature that studies the value of political connections (Khwaja and Mian, 2005,Fisman and Svensson, 2007,Fan et al., 2008a,Li et al., 2008,Duchin and Sosyura, 2012,Amore and Bennedsen, 2013,Borisov et al., 2016,Heitz et al., 2021). Gauging the value of political connections between firms and government is of great interest in the fields of political economy and corporate finance.Fisman (2001)takes advantage of rumors about political figures to probe the impact of political connections on firms’ performance in Indonesia. The author finds that political connections account for a great portion of market values of most politically dependent firms.Goldman et al. (2009)investigate the political connections of the boards of directors of all S&P 500 companies and show a positive correlation between companies’ stock returns and political connections. Compared to those visible benefits of political connections,Heitz et al. (2021)explore relaxed enforcement and circumvention of regulations, which are less visible ways through which the benefits from political connections pay off.This study also contributes to another strand of the literature, which emphasizes the social cost side of political connectedness. Earlier studies have proposed theoretical bases to untangle the social costs and benefits of political rent-seeking by firms (Leff, 1964).Fisman and Wang (2015)document that the number of workplace deaths at politically connected firms is much higher than that at unconnected firms. Using data on public listed firms in France,Bertrand et al. (2018)find that politically connected CEOs would use firm resources to help connected politicians, even when the total benefits for the firm are not justifiable, resulting in elevated operating costs to connected firms. In addition to political connections between government officials and firms, connections between government officials at different ranks may also bring about economic inefficiency.Kahn et al. (2020)document that the site selection of industrial parks in China is influenced by political connections. The authors find that industrial parks built as the consequence of favorable political connections between city officials and provincial leaders generate lower economic benefits compared with those built based on considerations of local economic fundamentals.Moreover, this study adds empirical evidence to an emerging strand of literature on political connections and firms’ environmental behaviors in China.Zhang (2017)investigates the effect of political connections on firms’ engagement in corporate environmental responsibility, which is regarded as a beneficial business strategy. The author defines political connections by determining if the CEO of a company is a former or current government official, which is similar to our definition. While the paper does not examine the influence of political connections on firms’ pollution emissions directly, it concludes that political connections positively impact corporate environmental responsibility. The author argues that political connections enable companies to access government grants, subsidies, and tax reductions related to environmental protection, which in turn helps local governments to achieve their environmental objectives.Deng et al. (2019)investigate how the turnover of local government officials and a firm’s political connections affect pollution emissions. The study employs a 2SLS approach and finds that an increase in pollution discharge can be attributed to the appointment of newly promoted or transferred officials from the local area or other regions. Additionally, the study finds that political connections lead to a reduction in pollution discharge during the first year of the newly appointed officials’ tenure, which echoes our findings that the impact of political connections takes time to accumulate. Our work complements the paper by exploring variations in the entering and departing of top managers with political connections, and highlighting the rent-seeking behavior of politically connected firms.Finally, our study relates to a more recent paper byDeng et al. (2020), which investigates the relationship between political connections and pollution emissions by firms. The paper uses the birthplace information of local officials and top managers to construct the political connection variable. It employs a Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (POLS) model with fixed effects at the city and industry levels. While the study finds significant effects of political connections on COD and SO2emissions, there are concerns about endogeneity issues with their identification strategy and modeling approach. Our study utilizes more direct information, the political working experience of firms’ top managers, to analyze the impact of political connections. We also employ a more robust modeling approach that includes firm-level fixed effects and incorporates various linear trends across different provinces and industries. Our findings suggest that political connections lead to an increase in firms’ COD emissions, rather than SO2emissions. This disparity in results may also be due to differences in the study period. While the previous work focuses on the period after the release of the 11th Five-Year Plan, which brought significant changes in national environmental policies, our study extends the timeframe to include data before the 11th Five-Year Plan. We demonstrate that the positive impact of political connections on water pollution persists even when government officials have strong incentives to suppress pollution issues. Moreover, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous effects of political connections on pollution emissions and provide direct evidence of the potential mechanism behind the impact of political connections on firms’ pollution emission.The manuscript proceeds as follows. Section2first provides a brief background on major political institutions, political connections, and industrial pollution emissions in China. This section also includes a descriptive analysis on the data. Section3introduces the identification strategy and discusses the results.

"2. The modelIn this section, we describe the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for controlling an invasive species with imperfect information about the level of infestation. The model described here is quite general including potentially many management actions and levels of infestation. In Section3, we apply the POMDP to a specific case with four mutually exclusive management actions, including monitoring and treatment, and three possible levels of infestation.Suppose there arenpossible states of the ecosystem representing different levels of infestation, indexed byi,i= 1, …,n. At the beginning of each period,t= 1, …,T, the decision-maker does not know for sure the current state of the ecosystem and instead has a set of beliefs represented by a probability distribution (π1t, …,πnt), whereπitequals the probability of being in stateiat the start of periodt,πit≥ 0,∑iπit=1. Each periodt, the manager chooses a management action,a, from the feasible management setA, based on the current vector of belief probabilities (π1t, …,πnt). Following the management action, the state of the infestation may change, and we define ann×ntransition matrixPawhere each elementpijaequals the probability of moving from stateiin periodtto statejin periodt+ 1 after taking actiona.Recognizing that the manager may not observe the true state of the infestation, we define an indexθ= 1, …,nfor the states that the manager may observe in periodt+ 1 after taking an action in periodt. Further, we define ann×nmatrixRawith elementsrjθa,j= 1, …,nandθ= 1, …,nwhere each elementrjθais the probability that the manager observes an infestation stateθin periodt+ 1 given an actual infestation statejafter taking actionain periodt, withrjθa≥0and∑θ=1nrjθa=1. The probability of correctly observing infestation statejisrjja. Forθ≠j,rjθais the probability of observing an incorrect infestation state. The matrixRarepresents the probability distributions of observations for all of the potential statesj= 1, …,n.We use the matrixRaof probabilities of observing the infestation in different states to update the manager's belief probabilities from periodtto periodt+ 1. Given an observed stateθafter taking actionain periodtand the set of prior belief probabilities (π1t, …,πnt), Bayes’ rule provides an estimate of the updated belief probability,πjt+1, of being in statejperiodt+ 1:(1)πjt+1|θ,a=∑i=1nπitpijarjθa∑i=1n∑k=1nπitpikarkθaThe updated probability of being in statejin periodt+ 1,πjt+1|θ,a, depends on the observed stateθafter taking actionain periodt. The updated belief probability is the ratio of the probability of observing stateθgiven the true state isj(numerator) and the probability of observing stateθover all possible statesk= 1,…,n(denominator). Without a perfect signal there will be some uncertainty about the true state. If the manager were to always observe the true infestation state, then the observation matrixRawould be an identity matrix and there would be no uncertainty about the state.In our model, the manager faces two types of costs: damage costs and management costs. Letdiabe the damage costs for a time period starting in stateiand taking management actiona. Letmiabe the management cost for a time period (e.g., the cost of monitoring and/or treatment) starting in stateiand taking management actiona.At the beginning of each periodt= 1, …,T− 1, the manager's problem is to determine the best action given the set of beliefs about the infestation state. We define an optimal value functionVt(π1t, …,πnt) as the minimum discounted cost of optimal actions beginning periodtwith belief state (π1t, …,πnt) until the terminal periodT. With this notation, the manager's problem can be formulated as a discrete-time dynamic program:(2)Vt(π1t,…,πnt)=mina∈A∑i=1nπit(dia+mia)+δ∑i=1n∑j=1n∑θ=1nπitpijarjθaVt+1(π1t+1|θ,a),…,(πnt+1|θ,a)t=1,…,T−1with terminal condition,(3)VTπ1T,…,πnT=mina∈A∑iπiT(dia+mia)The first term inside the brackets of Eq.(2)is the expected cost in periodtof taking actionagiven the current belief probabilities (π1t, …,πnt). The second term inside the brackets of Eq.(2)is the expected discounted cost in periodt+ 1 after taking actionain periodt, whereδis the discount factor. Expected discounted cost in periodt+ 1 is the weighted sum of the optimal values associated with all possible sets of updated belief states where each weight,πitpijarjθa, represents the probability of beginning in statei, moving to statej, and making observationθ, after taking actiona.We use a discrete, stochastic dynamic programming algorithm to find approximately optimal solutions to the POMDP problem represented by Eqs.(1),(2),(3). Although numerical procedures based on linear programming have been developed to find exact solutions to POMDP problems (seeMonahan, 1982andCassandra, 1994for reviews), these procedures are complicated and require custom software.The stochastic dynamic programming algorithm works as follows. For computational reasons, we define discrete classes for the belief probability for each infestation statei. Each elementπitof the probability distribution of beliefs in periodt(π1t, …,πnt) is assigned to one of the discrete probability classes. Increasing the number of classes means we come closer to the probabilities calculated using Bayes’ rule (Eq.(1)) and more closely approximate the optimal answer. The dynamic program (Eq.(2)) is solved backward starting from the terminal periodT(Eq.(3)). In each periodt, the optimal value functionVt(π1t, …,πnt) is calculated for each belief state (π1t, …,πnt) by choosing the management action with the minimum expected discounted cost. To calculate the expected discounted cost of a given management actiona, we first calculate the expected cost of the action in periodt(first summation inside the brackets in Eq.(2)). Then, we use Bayes’ rule (Eq.(1)) to calculateπjt+1|θ,a, the updated belief probability of being in statejin periodt+ 1 given observationθafter management actionawas applied. The updated beliefπjt+1|θ,ais then assigned to one of the discrete probability classes. Repeating this procedure for all statesj= 1, …,n, we obtain the updated belief state ((π1t+1|θ,a), …, (πnt+1|θ,a)). Finally, the optimal values associated with the updated belief states,Vt+1((π1t+1|θ,a), …, (πnt+1|θ,a)), for all possible state transitions and observations are used to calculate the expected discounted cost starting in periodt+ 1 from taking actionain periodt(second summation inside the brackets in Eq.(2)).The backward recursion is solved iteratively from periodTto period 1. The result is an optimal policy that gives the best action to take in each periodtfor each belief state along with the optimal value of that action. Strictly speaking, our dynamic programming algorithm finds approximately optimal rather than exactly optimal solutions because the updated beliefs calculated using Bayes’ rule (Eq.(1)) are classified into discrete probability classes. While simple in concept, this dynamic programming algorithm is very time consuming when applied to problems with many system states and actions. In the next section we solve for optimal solutions in the case where there are three possible states of the ecosystem and four mutually exclusive actions.",Robert,Stephen,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 32, Issue 4, November 2010, Pages 519-533",50,male,male,,,,Male

"3. Model and implementation3.1. Ecological and economic components of the problemThe search decision is a function of the damages and costs anticipated across time and space from an invasion emanating from a likely point of entry. We model growth as spatially and population-dependent, with the specific form dependent on the bioeconomic properties of its spread. In our case we use a diffusion model, discussed here. We model costs as an area-specific function of search effort, and marginal damages (per specimen) as area-specific functions of the resources threatened by the species’ presence. Details of the growth, cost, and damage functions are described here to contextualize the problem.We do not formally model uncertainty beyond that regarding the point of entry, using expected values for marginal damages, marginal costs, and an area's invasion population at a given time.We parameterize the model using data from Hawaii and Guam, and investigate across 30 years of potential snake presence on the island of Oahu to identify the net benefits of EDRR. We initially assume that decisions are made without concern for a budget constraint in order to identify the net damage-minimizing search strategy.3We later investigate the impact of land managers’ inability to expect ready funds by imposing a temporal constraint on the availability of funds for search, mimicking the very real possibility of searches not made for lack of funding.3.1.1. Expected populations and growthWe model the spread and population of the invader using a Skellam–Fisher diffusion process common in biological models (Shigesada and Kawasaki, 1997), and now growing in use in bioeconomic models (Clark, 2005,Wilen, 2007). The diffusion process has been modified in our numerical solutions to accommodate discrete time and space as well as human intervention both within and across cells. Other choices, such as metapopulation models, are potentially appropriate but the biological research on the snake suggests diffusion is the best choice for our application.In our diffusion process, populations increase by (weighted) radial expansion and by internal growth.4Assuming an initial distribution wheren0individuals invade the origin att= 0, each celli= 1, …,Icontains untreated populations from diffused growth:(1)nD(i,t)=n04πDtexpbt−r(i)24DtuntilnD(i,t) =nγ, wherenγis a threshold population level at which the growth function changes, after which growth is represented by a logistic function. Here,r(i) is the discrete, weighted radial distance from the origin to the center of the celli,Dis the diffusion coefficient, andbis the intrinsic growth rate (values fornγ,D, andbare discussed below).The radial distance,r(i), is weighted for terrain accessibility, using Geographical Information Systems software (ArcGIS 9), by distance from roads. Roads are expected to provide the most rapid expansion paths (Timmins et al., 2006); distance from roads slows the radial spread. This can be seen in the uneven concentric expansion across the island inFig. 1, in which we map the expected radial spread, and is calculated in ArcView 9 by increasing the radii proportionally as accessibility decreases according to the findings inWiles et al. (2003).Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Expected annual snake expansion, entry at HNL (3/4 weight), Barber's Point (1/8 weight) or Schofield (1/8 weight).Fig. 1shows expected expansion patterns of the snakes from an initial invasion at the Honolulu Airport (HNL) or the adjacent Hickam Air Force Base Airport, from Schofield Barracks, or from Barber's Point Air Station, weighted by historical interceptions.5These are selected as the most likely points of entry because of the eight Brown treesnakes that have been intercepted on Oahu, five were at HNL, two were at Schofield (with one of these known to have been transported directly from HNL), and one was discovered at Barber's Point.The rate of expansion (without intervention) is a function ofD, the diffusion coefficient, which we estimate to be 1.067 km2/y (Shigesada and Kawasaki, 1997: 51, from an associated expansion rate of 1.6 km/y (Wiles et al., 2003)), and the intrinsic growth rate,b, which we estimate to be 0.6, as well as timetand the initial population,n0.The expansion path illustrated inFig. 1translates directly to population when population is low, but as population increases in a cell, intraspecific competition is accounted for by switching to a logistic growth function. Thus,nγis the population at which the growth paths for diffusive, exponential growth and logistic growth diverge, given carrying capacity, herenγ= 40. (Shigesada and Kawasaki, 1997,Burnett and Kaiser, 2007) After this point, internal growth dominates and untreated populations grow according to a logistic function,nl, where:(2)nl(i,t)=nγKiebtKi+nγ(ebt−1),in whichKiis the carrying capacity of the cell. We estimate from maximum densities experienced on Guam that the maximum snake carrying capacity in any cell (soKi=K) is 200 snakes.Human intervention affects the population of a cell directly, as we assume that search of an area is efficient in that any specimens located in a searched area are caught and removed. The result is that damages are not incurred in that time period and the population, if any, is reduced to 0, but restarted with diffused growth. We refer to this as ‘treatment’ of an area. Furthermore, search of any area today changes the expected radial spread of populations across the entire habitat for the next period, so the greater the search effort, the slower the expected diffused growth across the entire habitat.6If a cell is already expected to be driven by internal growth, changes in the population of other cells do not affect a cell's expected population.Thus the cell populations are:(3)nit=n(i,t,tξi,ξit,∑iξit−1)=((∑iξit−1)/(I))*nDit−tξi*(1−ξit),if≤nrnlit−tξi*(1−ξit),otherwisewheretξiis the time period of the last search treatment for celli, andξit= 1 if a cell is searched at timetandξit= 0 otherwise. The larger the proportion of treated cells in the previous period(∑iξit−1)/(I), the lower the rate of expected population expansion, or alternatively the lower the expected population that has escaped notice island-wide.If the entire island were to be searched then the population would fall to 0 and no damages would occur until another invasion. We simplify by assuming that a new snake arrives in the next year (alternatively, that a snake is missed). This resetting ofnDis accounted for by the time lagtξi.3.1.2. DamagesFig. 2illustrates the range of marginal (per snake) damages across Oahu. Damages are calculated using a per snake linear coefficient that varies from a minimum of $0 and a maximum of $2143. Damages consist of three potential impacts: power outages, medical costs and human-snake interactions, and biodiversity losses.7Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. Marginal damages.First, Brown treesnakes are known to cause frequent power outages by damaging power transformers and power lines. Localized hour-long power outages on Guam occur on average every other day, with longer but less frequent wide-scale power outages when snakes interact with main power lines or transformers. We anticipate that an average snake will cause 1.01 × 10−4power outages per year, that per-person power outage damages are $1.50, and that an island-wide power outage causes $1.2 m in damages (Burnett et al., 2006,Fritts, 1998, personal communication). Thus, cells where only localized power outages are expected will have expected damages equal to the population in the cell (determined from census 2000 census block population density figures) times per-person damages times the per snake rate of outages, or:δpl=popn*1.5*1.01×10−4Cells where main power lines are located have expected damages per snake of:δph=1.2×106*1.01×10−4*power=121.2where power is an indicator variable for whether main power lines are present in the cell.Second, Brown treesnakes are venomous and Guam's infestation has generated an average of 170 bites per year with average costs of $264.35 per bite. This is an expected per snake bite rate of 6.31 × 10−5for Guam. We generate a bite rate for each Oahu cell by multiplying the Guam per snake bite rate by the population density of the cell (again from the census block 2000 data) adjusted by the population density on Guam (UNPD, 2001). Using this bite rate, we then calculate the expected direct medical damages as the bite rate*average costs.Additionally, Hawaii has no snakes at present; human-snake interactions are expected to reduce tourism and local quality of life significantly (Shwiff et al., 2010). Following conservative estimates for patterns of legal settlements of compensatory versus punitive damages for psychological suffering and other intangible losses (Eisenberg et al., 1997), and other evidence on the ratio of physical damages to psychic ones, including U.S. congressional recommendations for limiting punitive damages to no more than three times the physical damages (Kahneman et al., 1998), we use the anticipated physical medical damages as a minimum per-person estimate in the loss of well-being generated by the snakes to generate an indirect ‘medical cost’, so that total human-snake interaction damages for each snake for each location are estimated at:8δm=biterate*popn*264.35Finally, adult Brown treesnakes prey upon birds, and Oahu's endangered birds, which have not co-evolved with snakes, are likely to fare as badly as Guam's indigenous birds have. On Guam, 11 of 18 indigenous species (Vice, 2006, personal communication) have been extirpated. On Oahu, one native bird species occurs on island (Elepaio,Chasiempis sandwichensis ibidis) and its habitat covers only about 26,400 ha of the 1500 km2. Other birds at risk have habitat on other islands and are less likely to be rendered extinct through the presence of the snake, though the population losses will increase the probability of extirpation and extinction. Cells with habitat for the elepaio are estimated to have per snake damages of $6.52, based on willingness-to-pay estimates determined for households in Hawaii for the existence of bird species, and cells with other native bird habitat are estimated to have per snake damages of $1.13 (Loomis and White, 1996,Burnett et al., 2006).9Biodiversity losses per snake per cell are thus:δb=6.52*elepaio+1.13*otherbirdwhere elepaio and otherbird are indicator variables for the presence of elepaio and other native bird habitats, respectively.The per snake damage function for each cell is therefore,δi=δpl+δph+δm+δbso that the damage function is:di(ni)=δi*nit=(δpl+δph+δm+δb)*nit3.1.3. CostsAs discussed, a particular distinction between EDRR and other discussions of invasive species control is that with EDRR one is searching thoroughly, as if trapping the last snake in a population control situation, while with control one generally assumes one can “harvest” a known population of the invasive species, balancing costs of the marginal specimen captured with damages from the remaining population directly. We describe Brown treesnake EDRR treatment as consisting of preventative search, trapping and hand-removal (the only way to currently remove snakes too small to be trapped). Costs vary with terrain. Records on the costs of clearing an enclosed 5 ha plot on Guam (Rodda, personal communication) provide a least cost estimate of removing snakes from an area. Costs are scaled up from this base cost of $6,352 per 4 ha cell to account for slope of the terrain and distance from a road. The steeper the grade, the more energy required to search the area. Since the cost of searching is a labor cost, we use a model from the American College of Sports Medicine to translate grade into energy expenditure, and then increase costs proportionally to the increase in effort. The energy expenditure rate (EER) is estimated to be:(4)EER=0.1v+1.8v⋅a+3.5wherevis the speed of walking andais the percent grade (Sabatini et al., 2004). We assume a constant slow rate of walking at 0.5 km/h to accommodate searching (Rodda, personal communication, Lardner, personal communication). Average slope for each cell is calculated from hillshade projections of Oahu in ArcGIS 9.1. Rugged terrain (steep or highly variable slopes) and high elevation are the most costly to search, while cells near roads, flatter and closer to sea level require less energy and effort and are therefore less expensive to employ EDRR.For each cell, we first calculate the energy expenditure rate, EER. We then generate an energy expenditure ratio where we divide the cell's EER by the EER when the slope is 0, which provides an estimate of how much more difficult clearing the cell is than clearing the 5 ha test plot (which was on level ground) cost. This ratio is therefore multiplied by the base cost of $6,352.10Costs also increase with the distance of the cell needing treatment from accessible roads. We use analogous methodology to determine distance costs from roads by using ArcView Spatial Analyst to calculate the least cost distance path. First, based on the EER from the nearest road to the cell, we determine the least cost EER path from the nearest road to the cell. Then we create a ratio of this distance cost to the linear distance from the road. We then multiply this ratio by the labor cost of reaching the cell, estimated at $60 per unit. The maximum access cost is approximately $3420, while the average is approximately $540. The total cost for celli,Ci, is then the sum of the in-cell treatment cost and the distance (access) cost.11,123.2. Bioeconomic modelA manager who expects there has been an invasion that has escaped detection at a port of entry can choose whether to initiate an EDRR response and search, or wait until the invasion is confirmed without search costs, at which point population control might begin. Because low-population control will suffer some of the same difficulties as EDRR in terms of determining where and when to best to target removals, our deterministic model of an unfolding invasion in effect addresses both policies. As EDRR bridges the gap between prevention at bottleneck entry points and control, the best places to search will also be the first places one will attempt removals if snake populations unfold as expected. While more elaborate modeling would incorporate the exact number of snakes removed upon a search and using that to update expectations or allow marginal tradeoffs between snakes controlled today and those left for the future within an area, the complexity of such modeling is not necessary to highlight the importance of EDRR as a management option when populations or their associated damages may be masked for a period before becoming known. For additional insights into the role of uncertainty in EDRR (without explicit spatial considerations), see Haight and Polasky (this issue).Thus our theoretical model is formalized as:(5)Minξit∑iI∑t=0Tβt(di(nit)+Ci(ξit))s.t.(6)nit=n(i,t,tξi,ξit,∑iξit−1)and(7)ξit∈{0,1}and(8)∑iCit≤At∀twherenitis the population of the cell at timetas a function of biological growth (determined by diffusive and internal growth and a function over time of the cell's location,i), EDRR search (treatments) in the cell today (ξit) and all other cells(∑iξit−1)in the previous period, as well as the time since the last search treatment in the cell,t−tξi, as described in Section3.1.1and stated in Eq.(3). Expected damages,di, are the total expected damages for area (cell)ias a function of populationnit, as described (Section3.1.2).Ciis the cost of EDRR for celli, also as determined (Section3.1.3).Iis the total number of cells,βrepresents the discount factor, andAtrepresents a temporally constrained appropriations budget for EDRR, should such a consideration arise.SpendingCibrings the expected population for periodtto 0 for an area, but invasion from other parts of the island, or anew from off-island, re-initiates growth in the next period.Because the control variableξis a binary integer, 1 if removal that period and 0 otherwise, standard first order conditions are not possible. In order to understand the nature of our solution, we write discrete versions of the necessary conditions. Taking the difference between the Lagrangian withξit= 1 and withξit= 0, this condition is:(9)ΔL=L(ξit=1)−L(ξit=0)=∑tβt[∑i(di(nit[1])+Ci(1)+λit(n(i,t,tξi,ξit,∑iξit−1)−nit[1]))]−∑tβt[∑i(di(nit[0])+Ci(0)+λit(n(i,t,tξi,ξit,∑iξit−1)−nit[0]))]=βt(di(nit[1])−di(nit[0])+Ci(1)−Ci(0)+λit[nit[1]−nit[0]])≤0(10)⇒Ci(1)≤di(nit[0])+λitnit0(11)⇒Ci(1)−di(nit[0])nit[0]≤λit,orCi(1)nit[1]−di(nit[0])nit[0]≤λitwhereλitis the (approximate) shadow value of specimens in celliat timet. From Eq.(10), the cost of control should not exceed the imputed damages from specimens in the cell, where these costs reflect both current and future values. From Eq.(11), the average cost of control net of the average damage of a specimen not removed should not exceed the shadow value of the current population for control to be worthwhile.3.3. ImplementationConsider that Oahu's 1500 km2are divisible into a grid of approximately 38,000 cells measuring 4 ha each. Using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software (ArcView 9), each cell is assigned initial properties that include currently existent data on likelihood of snake presence (distance from points of entry, proximity to roads13), resource assets at risk (bird habitat, presence of power transmission lines, human population density) and accessibility of treatment (proximity of roads and trails, slope). We use this information to determine explicit spatially dependent values forr(i),di(nit), andCias described in Section3.The objective will be to minimize the present value of costs and damages over a 30 year time horizon for EDRR as described in our model. Since treatment decisions are EDRR search decisions, the unit of decision is the spatial cell rather than the snake population directly.We use Microsoft Excel and Palisade's Evolver Industrial Version, a genetic algorithm solver add-on to Microsoft Excel, for analysis.14We program MS Excel using the expected values for costs, damages, and population spread and growth so that we have three interconnected matrices that together can be used for dynamic analysis and optimization. The first of our three matrices generates population values, as described in Section3.1.1. For each spatial cell, the population is calculated for 30 years from an initial expected invasion and varies with EDRR treatment of the cell.If no treatment occurs, the population grows according to its biological limitations and location on the island. For all other treatment levels, the diffused growth population of each cell is reduced by the percentage of treated cells on the island.15This is considered roughly equivalent to searching an area that should havenitsnakes, finding it does not, and reducing expected populations island-wide. The more cells that are treated in any time period, the smaller the remaining population available to spread across the island, or the fewer hiding places for a very small population.Treatment of a cell (ξit= 1) returns the base population for the subsequent time period toni1, the expected re-infestation from diffused growth, at a cost ofCi, and resets the expected population from that point. Therefore our second matrix consists of the binary treatment decisions,ξit. This is the (binary integer) control variable in the optimization.Net damages are calculated for each cell as a function of whether it is treated or not and its population; in our third linked matrix, net damages for a cell at timetare equal to either untreated damages or the cost of treatment, in other wordsCi(ξit)+di(nit[ξit]). The present value of these net damages over all cells for 30 years is summed and forms the object of minimization.To solve this optimization, we begin by bounding the problem to treat cells as soon as the current benefits of doing so outweigh the current costs. We consider this to be a myopic solution in that it misses opportunities for aggressive treatments that reduce the invasive population. It is, however, a solution that managers find appealing as it avoids searching for infestations that do not exist. We label an EDRR solution that searches a cell only when the current benefits outweigh the current costs as the “myopic policy solution.”From this initial benchmark, we take three steps to improve upon our solution. First, we set Evolver to search for mutations from this myopic solution that improve upon the minimization. Over 50,000 trials of mutations initiated from the myopic solutions as well as 20,000 trials of random mutations across space and time resulted in zero cases of improved outcomes. We interpret this as confidence that the myopic solution provides a reasonable upper bound for minimization.Our theoretical results suggest that the myopic solution is incomplete in that it neglects the final term of Eq.(6), as the shadow values are not included. As a next step, then, we identify cells for treatment that lower the total net damages over time even when their current costs outweigh current damages. We begin to do this by applying the myopic solutions (where current damages outweigh current costs) generated for different growth rates. This systematically captures the cells where expected damages over time are most different from current damages, and therefore the most likely cases to benefit from targeted search even when current costs are less than current damages.Finally, following this, we sort the cell locations by their treatment costs and marginal damages, and use brute force to test whether the new solution can be improved upon for cells where damages are relatively high or fast growing or costs are relatively low. These are identified as locations where at least one treatment occurred over the 30 years under the myopic solution where growth was assumed to be 0.7. By assuming that growth is somewhat higher than our estimated value of 0.6, we can systematically identify cells with more rapidly growing damages toward the end of the 30 year period, which will benefit from treatment but are not identified under the myopic policy solution. We tested whether using an even higher growth rate to identify potential cells for search would lead to any new net damage-minimizing treatments; it does not. Targeting these cells would be too aggressive.This combination of steps resulted in our optimal solution, described next.",Brooks,Kimberly,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 32, Issue 4, November 2010, Pages 566-585",67,male,unknown,,,,Mix

"2. The modelSuppose that a stationary industry ofnfirms is producing a homogeneous good. The linear inverse demand function is given by:(1)P=P(Q)=a−b∑i=1nqia,b>0,whereqidenotes the level of production of firmi.In addition to producing output, firms emit a homogeneous pollutant, and each unit of output generates a unit of emissione(∂ei/∂qi= 1). To manage this emission, firms install an abatement technology. AsMontero (2002a, p. 314), I assumed that the total abatement cost for each firm can be described asciri2, whereriis the quantity of emissions that firmireduces, or:(2)ri=qi−ei.There are no further production costs.Current abatement costs are heterogeneous. Firms can be ranked according to an index of cost, and they are ordered, without loss of generality, from the firm with the highest index cost to the firm with the lowest cost; soc1>c2> ⋯ >ci> ⋯ >cn.2Suppose a new technology becomes available and can be adopted by any at a costK. This technology allows firms to reduce emissions at a lower total abatement costcri2, sincec1> ⋯ >ci> ⋯ >cn>c, and no further technical advance is anticipated.3The interaction between the firms and the regulator follows a certain pattern. The new technology arrives at the beginning of period 1. After noting its arrival, the regulator anticipates how many firms will optimally adopt the technology and announces a new allowed level of emissions. Let us assume that efficiency calls for universal adoption. Thus, the regulator sets the environmental policy such that theex postamount of emissions is optimal according to the marginal cost of the new technology. At this point, firms start to adopt.LetπiNA(m)be the rate of Cournot–Nash profit flow to firmi, whenmfirms have adopted the new technology and firmibelongs to the fraction that has not adopted yet. LetπiA(m)be the rate of Cournot–Nash profit flow to firmi, whenmfirms have adopted and firmibelongs to the fraction that has already adopted. It is assumed thatπiNA(m)andπiA(m)are known with certainty by firms as the marginal cost of the new technology.It is also assumed that, as the number of firms that adopt the new technology increases, more firms will enter the market to supply the new technology. This lowers the adoption costKaccording to the functionρ(τi)=Ke−(δ+θi)τi, whereτiis the date of adoption of firmiandδis the intertemporal discount rate. Thus, the investment cost decreases with the number of firms that have already adopted at a rateθi, whereθiexhibits the usual properties:θi> 0,∂θi/∂i>0, and∂2θi/∂i2≤0.Suppose that we order the adoption dates, such that 0 <τ1≤τ2≤ ⋯ ≤τi−1≤τi≤τi+1≤ ⋯τn< ∞. In line withReinganum (1981), the following assumptions are required for this sequence to be a perfect equilibrium in sub-games (seeAppendix A)(i)[π1A(m)−π1NA(m−1)]>⋯>⋯[πiA(m)−πiNA(m−1)]>⋯[πnA(m)−πnNA(m−1)]∀m≤n.That is, firms are given an ordering of their adoption benefits such that the increase in profits to firmidue adopting is larger than the increase in profits to firmi+ 1 regardless the number of firms that have already adopted. This assumption is reasonable in light of the abatement costs’ order. That is, since firm 1 has more firms at a cost disadvantage before it adopts, it can benefit the most from technological adoption.(ii)ρ′(0)>π1A(1)−π1NA(0).This assumption ensures that immediate adoption is too costly. As pointed out by Reinganum, this is not a particularly strong assumption in light of the adjustment cost literature.(iii)limτn→∞ρ′(τn)>0.That is, the decrease in the investment costs cannot continue indefinitely, which rules out infiniteτi.(iv)Δπi−1e[θi−1−θi]τi−1−[θi−1−θi]Ke[−θi]τi−1>Δπi>Δπi+1e[θi+1−θi]τi+1−[θi+1−θi]Ke[−θi]τi+1.This assumption4states that the adoption cost decreases with the number of firms that has already adopted at a (sufficiently slowly) increasing rate to ensure that firmi's objective function (as defined below) is strictly concave ini's choice variableτi.The present value of firmi's profits, net of the adoption costs when it adopts the new technology on dateτi, can be characterized asVi(τ1,…,τi,…,τn):(3)Vi(τ,…,τi,…,τn)=∑m=0i−1∫τmτm+1πiNA(m)e−δtdt+∑m=in∫τmτm+1πiA(m)e−δtdt−Ke−(δ+θi)τi,whereτ0= 0 andτn+1= ∞.The optimal date of adoption for each firm is found by maximizingVivia the choice ofτifrom the interval [τi−1,τi+1].5(4)∂Vi∂τi=[πiNA−πiA]e−δτi∗+(δ+θi)Ke−(δ+θi)τi∗=0.From Eq.(4), we observe that firmiwill adopt the new technology when the costs of delaying adoption equal the benefits. The costs of delaying adoption of the technology correspond to the difference in the profit flows due to the lower marginal abatement cost, while the benefits of postponing adoption are equal to the opportunity cost of saving the initial investment.

"2. The modelA number of trade-offs have to be considered when deciding on a harvest policy. For instance, if there is uncertainty regarding growth of the fish stock, it might be better to wait for the stock to increase significantly before harvesting, to minimize the risk of extinction. On the other hand, waiting too long might not be wise because it would delay receipt of the cash and thereby reduce its present value. Such a trade-off can be captured by using a stochastic growth process to incorporate uncertainty, and an appropriate discount rate for timing considerations. Also, because of limits to growth implied by environmental carrying capacity, growth is faster when the stock level is lower. Thus, it might make sense to harvest larger amounts, in order to keep stock levels low (to encourage faster growth). On the other hand, keeping the fish stock low is risky under uncertainty, because of the risk of extinction. Such a trade-off can be captured by using a mean-reverting growth process that explicitly incorporates an environmental carrying capacity, along with a stochastic component that allows us to incorporate the risk of extinction. Further, the negative economic effect of frequent harvesting can be captured by including both fixed and variable harvesting costs. We have tried to set up a model that incorporates most of the relevant and significant trade-offs.The objective here (as inLi, 1998,Saphores, 2003) is the optimal social management of the resource. Thus the manager will aim to maximize the present value of the cash flow stream from successive harvests to infinity (or till extinction of the stock). The resource manager faces an identical problem after each harvest, hence it becomes a stationary problem.2.1. The settingAs inLi (1998)andSaphores (2003), we assume that there is a single decision-maker for the fishery, who has discretion over the timing of the harvest. Further, the harvesting decision is irreversible (i.e., the fish cannot be returned to the habitat). Then the decision to harvest is similar to exercising an American option. Also consistent with real-option models, we consider discrete instantaneous harvests rather than a continuous harvesting rate.Similar to the exercise of an American option, harvesting occurs when the fish stock reaches a critical level. The optimal critical level is determined in our model. The amount to be harvested (can be partial or total harvesting) is also determined optimally. If partially harvested, the remaining fish stock grows until it reaches the critical level again, at which point another similar harvest will take place, and so on. If the entire fish stock is harvested, then the fish stock becomes extinct and the process ends. In a perpetual setting, there can be an infinite number of harvests. This ensures that the harvesting decision is a stationary one, which requires solving an ordinary differential equation (rather than the more difficult partial differential equation) for option value; further, the optimal harvest trigger is time-independent.In terms of option exercise, the option to harvest will be exercised when the fish stock rises to the critical level. At exercise, the payoff is the net profit from the harvest plus the option to harvest the next time the fish stock reaches the critical level; thus, there is a series of such real options that need to be exercised optimally.2.2. Model specificationsIt is well known that, for fish stocks, the growth rate is inversely related to the stock level because of natural (carrying capacity) constraints. One of the best-known growth models with compensation is the logistic growth model (Clark, 1990,Conrad, 2008)—this is the growth process we use. In addition, because of significant uncertainty in the evolution of fish stocks, we include a stochastic component to the growth rate. The fish stock dynamics are given by the biomass (Xt) which evolves stochastically according to the process:(1)dX=rX1−XKdt+σXdzwhereris the intrinsic growth rate,Kthe environmental carrying capacity,σthe volatility (uncertainty) of the process, and dzthe increment of the standard Weiner process.As inLi (1998),Saphores (2003), etc., the production or harvest functionh(E,X) is given by(2)h(E,X)=qEXwhereqis the fixed catchability coefficient, andEis the harvesting effort.5Eq.(2)shows the amount harvested.The unit price of the harvested fish is a decreasing function of the harvest size (unlikeLi, 1998,Saphores, 2003). The exact form of the relationship is an open question, and various forms have been used in the literature. For instance,McDonald et al. (2002)use a linear relationship:p(h) =a−bh(wherepis price,his harvest size andaandbare constants), whileGrafton et al. (2006)use the log-linear relationship: lnp=a+blnh(equivalently,p=ea·hb). We use the latter specification, hence the price in our model is given by the inverse demand function:(3)p=a⋅hbwherehis the amount harvested, andaandbare constants (b≤ 0). In Eq.(3), the parameter “a” represents the general price level (or strength of demand) while the parameter “b” represents the sensitivity of price to catch size (note that the price elasticity from Eq.(3)is 1/|b|). The limiting caseb= 0 would imply that the price is independent of the catch size, i.e., the product market is perfectly competitive.Finally, there are fixed harvesting costs of $fper harvest and variable costs of $cper unit of effort; thus the total harvesting cost is $(f+cE). Then the profit or net revenues from the harvest is given byπ(E,X)=ph−cE−fwherep=a·hbandh=qEX. Thus the payoff function at harvest is(4)π(E,X)=a(qEX)b+1−cE−f2.3. The option to harvestAs described above, there is an option to harvest, hence there is no reason for harvesting immediately. In a real-option setting, the harvest will occur when the fish stockXrises to some critical level, called the harvest trigger. As stated above, this is a stationary problem; thus the option value will be a function ofXonly, sayV(X), and the optimal exercise trigger will be time-independent, sayX*.Then it can be shown that, prior to exercise, the option valueV(X) must satisfy the ordinary differential equation (ODE):(5)0.5σ2X2V″(X)+rX1−XKV′(X)−ρV(X)=0whereρis the appropriate (constant) discount rate. Eq.(5)can be solved for the option value, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions. The general solution to the ODE(5)is(6)V(X)=AXα1Mα1,2α1+2rσ2;2rX(σ2K)+BXα2Mα2,2α2+2rσ2;2rX(σ2K)whereM(a,b;z) is the confluent hypergeometric function (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972), given by(7)M(a,b;z)=1+azb+a(a+1)b(b+1)z22!+a(a+1)(a+2)b(b+1)(b+2)z33!+⋯In Eq.(6),AandBare constants to be determined by the boundary conditions, andα1andα2are the positive and negative solutions, respectively, to the quadratic equation(8)0.5σ2α(α−1)+rα−ρ=0and are given by(9)α1=0.5−rσ2+2ρσ2+0.5−rσ22>0(10)α2=0.5−rσ2−2ρσ2+0.5−rσ22>02.4. Boundary conditions and the optimal harvest triggerLower boundary(X=0): the lower boundary isX= 0. When this level is reached,Xcan never rise above zero again (sinceX= 0 is an absorbing boundary). Thus, reaching this boundary implies extinction of the fish stock, since the fish stock will remain at zero for ever thereafter;X= 0 therefore corresponds to extinction in this model.WhenXfalls to zero, clearly the value functionV(X) will also fall to zero, since there is no hope of recovery. Thus the lower boundary condition is given by:V(0) = 0. Sinceα1> 0 andα2< 0, this impliesB= 0 in Eq.(6). We can then write the option value as(11)V(X)=AXα1Mα1,2α1+2rσ2;2rX(σ2K)Upper boundary(X = X*): harvesting will occur atX=X*, and the harvested amount will beh=qEX*. The net profit from the harvest can be computed from Eq.(4):(12)π(E,X*)=a(qEX*)b+1−cE−fIn addition, the existing option will be replaced by a similar option to harvest again, but with the fish stock level reduced by the harvest amounth(orqEX*). Thus the value of the replacement option will beV(X* −h) orV((1 −qE)X*). This gives the upper boundary condition:(13)V(X*)=a(qEX*)b+1−cE−f+V((1−qE)X*)We have describedV(X) as the value of the option to harvest. Note, however, that this option has embedded in it the value of all future harvests as well. Thus,V(X) can also be viewed as the value of the fish stock (i.e., the expected present value of all future harvests) when the current fish stock level isX.6ForX* to be the optimal trigger, the following smooth-pasting condition must be satisfied (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994):(14)V′(X*)=∂π(E,X*)∂X*+V′((1−qE)X*)Solving Eqs.(13),(14)for the two unknownsAandX*, we get:(15)A=a(qEX*)b+1−cE−f(X*)−α1M3−M1(1−qE)α1We also get an implicit equation that can be solved numerically forX*:(16)a(b+1)X*(qEX*)b+1+Aα1(X*)α1−1(1−qE)α1M1+A(X*)α1(1−qE)α1α1r(1−qE)(α1σ2+r)KM2−Aα1(X*)α1−1M3−A(X*)α1α1r(α1σ2+r)KM4=0whereM1=Mα1,2α1+2rσ2;2rX*(1−qE)(σ2K),M2=Mα1+1,2α1+2rσ2+1;2rX*(1−qE)(σ2K),M3=Mα1,2α1+2rσ2;2rX*(σ2K),andM4=Mα1+1,2α1+2rσ2+1;2rX*(σ2K)We have solved the optimal harvesting trigger problem for a given effort levelE. We next identify the optimal effort levelE* and the resulting harvest quantityh*.2.5. Optimal harvesting effort and optimal harvest sizeSo far, the harvesting effortEhas been treated as an exogenously specified parameter. However, we are also interested in the optimal effort (which will give us the optimal harvest quantity from Eq.(2)). The optimal effort will be chosen so as to maximize the option value (or the value of the fish stock), V(X), for all values of X. That is,E*=argmaxEV(X),∀X, or(17)E*=argmaxEAXα1Mα1,2α1+2rσ2;2rX(σ2K),∀XSinceX,α1, andM( ) are all independent ofE, this meansEwill be chosen so as to maximize the parameterA. However, there is a constraint on the magnitude ofE—since the amount harvested cannot exceed the amount available, we need to impose the constraint:qEX* ≤X*, orE≤ 1/q. Then, using Eq.(15), the maximization problem becomes:(18)E*=argmaxEa(qEX*(E))b+1−cE−f(X*(E))−α1M3−M1(1−qE)α1s.t.E*≤1qIn Eq.(18), we writeX*(E) to highlight the dependence ofX* onE(this was suppressed so far). The optimal effortE* also has to be identified numerically. This is easily done by repeating the numerical procedure in Section2.4with different levels of harvesting effortE; for eachE, we find the appropriateX* andA, and the effort level that maximizesAis the optimal effortE*, as discussed above. OnceE* is known, the optimal harvest quantity is given byh* =qE*X*.2.6. Probability of extinctionNote that in the above model, extinction of the fish stock is not ruled out. For instance, if the fish stock is hit by a sequence of random negative shocks, it is possible thatXwill fall to zero prior to the next harvest; if this happens, the fish stock will never recover, since zero is an absorbing boundary.7The probability of such an event occurring is of great interest, since there is widespread concern regarding depletion and extinction of fish stocks worldwide (Clark, 1990,Conrad, 2008). This probability is evaluated below.LetP(X) = probability of extinction of the fish stock, i.e., the probability ofXreaching the lower boundary (zero) before it reaches the upper boundary (X*). That is(19)P(X)=Prob({X}reaches0beforeX*),0≤X≤X*Then it can be shown (Bhattacharya and Waymire, 1990, chapter V) thatP(X) must satisfy the ODE(20)0.5σ2X2P″(X)+rX1−XKP′(X)=0with the following boundary conditions:P(0) = 1 andP(X*) = 0. Eq.(20)has no explicit analytical solution, and has to be solved numerically.",Sudipto,None,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 31, Issue 4, November 2009, Pages 272-286",16,unknown,,,,,Mix
"1. IntroductionThe analysis of aggregate count demand systems to generate welfare measures is an increasingly important research challenge in which the researcher often contends with two important issues. One is the maintenance of the appropriate theoretical structure on the parameters in the model, necessary for welfare estimation. The second is the flexibility of the cross equation correlation restrictions which follow from what error structure is imposed on the demand system. This analysis suggests a econometric count data model that allows for cross equation correlation in an arbitrarily large system of count demand functions while maintaining a theoretically sound structure of which the standard willingness to pay measures are based.This analysis examines the recreational demand and welfare impact of the 40,000 acre Rat Creek Hatchery forest fire within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, a major recreational area two and a half hours east of Seattle, Washington. A system of demand equations is needed to capture the important elements of the analysis due to several aspects of the data. First, the fire affected multiple trails simultaneously mandating a system approach. Second, and perhaps more challenging, the focus of the welfare analysis is on the time path of nonmarket values before the fire and during the early stages of recovery at trails heterogeneously impacted by the fire. This requires an econometric approach that can accommodate a change in values over time periods. It also requires an approach that is flexible enough to capture the demand system’s changing error structure which is expected due to the alteration of the goods caused by the large scale ecosystem disturbance.Our paper contributes to the empirical literature through the development of the above model. Our analysis also provides an empirical test of the adding-up property of a Poisson random variable for use with aggregate data. Additionally, estimation results are interpreted as evidence that some wilderness users highly value a forest that is in the early stage of fire recovery characterized by increases in wildflowers, berries, and wildlife. This finding has resource management and policy implications.The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. The next section provides a brief literature background. The third section the lays out the modeling approach used in this paper. It has two sub-sections, one deals with the theoretical restrictions associated with this model while the second deals with the econometric approach implemented in this analysis. The fourth section discusses the data, while the remaining sections present the results and discuss the findings and limitations of the work.",James,Jeffrey,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 31, Issue 4, November 2009, Pages 287-298",17,male,male,,,,Male

"2. The modelConsider a partial equilibrium model of an economy composed ofnseparate local output markets of equal size. In each market, there is a representative consumer endowed with a quasilinear utility functionu(xi,m) =U(xi) +m, whereU(xi) is the utility derived from consumption of quantityxiof the final good of marketi, andmstands for consumption of the numeraire good.5In particular, it is assumed thatU(xi) = (A−xi/4)xi, whereAis a strictly positive parameter. Maximisation ofu(xi,m) subject to the budget constraintpixi+m≤I, wherepiindicates the unit price of the good andIstands for consumer income, yields the inverse demand function given byP(xi) =A−xi/2.Each market is operated by only one firm that has revenuesV(xi) =P(xi)·xi. Production of the good generates pollution; emissions permits allowing producers to generate a given level of pollution, directly or indirectly, are issued by a government through some mechanism (auctioning, grandfathering, bilateral negotiation, etc.). The outcome, in terms of social efficiency and government income, of this process constitutes the main subject of this paper. For the sake of simplicity, assume that emissions permits are the only input required for production as well as the only production cost; that the production technology is the same in all markets and is unalterable (which excludes any abatement costs); and finally that firms’ production is directly proportional to the emissions permits ‘acquired’. These assumptions mean that the assignment of emissions permits amounts to the assignment of production quotas, and therefore that one emissions permit corresponds to one unit of the final good. The total level of emissionsE,E> 0, is fixed exogenously (for example, by an international agreement such as the Kyoto protocol).Throughout the paper, the situation is that one of the producers, and only one, operates in more than one local market and accounts for the impact of its derived demand for permits on their price. This ‘dominant firm’ operates inkoutput markets, 1 <k<n. Other producers, who form the so-called ‘fringe’, are the same size, serving each of the remainingn−kmarkets and acting as price takers in permit markets. The level of total emissions permitsEsatisfies the following property.Assumption 1E<Emax≡(n−k)(n+k)nAThis assumption ensures that the cap on total emissions does indeed limit emissions and production, ∑ixi=E, and hence that the unit price of permits is positive, so long as the dominant firm holds emissions permits.Finally, assume that the government seeks to maximise a ‘regulator-utility’ or welfare function as(1)WG=∑iU(xi)+S(E)+μ⋅RG,whereRGis the government revenue from the issue of emissions permits,μis a non-negative parameter related to the shadow cost of public funds,6andS(E) represents the negative impact of aggregate pollution on welfare. Note, however, that in this paperS(E) is ignored becauseEis fixed exogenously.",Manel,Lluís,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 31, Issue 4, November 2009, Pages 320-333",5,male,unknown,,,,Mix
"2. Theoretical framework2.1. The directional output distance functionSuppose that a country employs a vector of inputs (such as labor, capital and energy use),x∈ℜK+to produce a vector of “good” outputs (such as GDP),y∈ℜM+,and “bad” outputs (such as SO2and CO2),b∈ℜN+. The technology is now defined as:(1)T={(x,y,b;t,q):xcanproduce(y,b)attimetandlongrunoilpriceq}The output is strongly or freely disposable if (y,b) ∈Tand (y′,b′) ≤ (y,b) ⇒ (y′,b′) ∈T.This implies that if an observed output vector is feasible, then any smaller output vector is also feasible. This assumption excludes production processes that generate bad outputs that are costly to dispose of. For example, concerns about pollutants (such as CO2and SO2) imply that these should not be considered freely disposable. In such cases, bad outputs are considered as being weakly disposable: (y,b) ∈Tand 0 ≤θ≤ 1 ⇒ (θy,θb) ∈T. This implies that pollution is costly to dispose of and abatement activities typically divert resources away from the production of desirable outputs and thus lead to lower good outputs for any given inputs. Moreover, good outputs are assumed to be null-joint with the bad outputs.5More formally, the directional output distance function is defined as6:(2)D(x,y,b;g,t,q)=maxβ{β:(y+β⋅gy,b−β⋅gb)∈T}This function requires the simultaneous reduction in bad outputs and expansion in good outputs. The computed value ofβ(β*) provides the maximum expansion of good outputs and contraction of bad outputs if a firm has to operate efficiently given the directional vectorg. The vectorg= (gy, −gb) specifies the direction an output vector ((y,b) ∈T) is scaled so as to reach the boundary of the output set at the point (y+β*·gy,b−β*·gb) ∈Tby expanding the good outputs and contracting the bad outputs whereβ* =D(x,y,b;g,t,q).The directional output distance function derives its properties from the production technologyT(Färe et al., 2005). The advantage of this function is that it allows one to consider nonproportional changes in output, since it is possible to expand good outputs, while contracting the bad outputs. This property is very useful in the study of the input–output choices of a polluting firm facing environmental regulation. The distance function takes the value of zero for technically efficient output vectors on the frontier, whereas positive values imply inefficient output vectors below the frontier. The higher the value, the more inefficient is the output vector. Moreover, the directional output distance function and revenue function are duals to each other (Färe et al., 2001,Färe et al., 2005).2.2. Malmquist–Luenberger productivity indicatorsWe extend the Malmquist–Luenberger measure of productivity change (PCH) to a measure that also accounts for ITCH. The productivity indicator is traditionally decomposed into technological change (TECH), or shifts in the production frontier, and efficiency change (EFFCH), or the movement of inefficient production units relative to the frontier which may be termed as ‘catch-up’ effect. We now further decompose TECH into ETCH and ITCH, i.e., TECH = ETCH + ITCH, as illustrated inFig. 1.Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Decomposition of productivity indicators.Suppose the direction of expansion(gy,−gb)is denoted byg. The output (bt,yt) vector in periodtis denoted bya, and the vector (bt+1,yt+1) in period (t+ 1) is denoted byd. The two technologies areTtandT′t+1. The shift in technology fromTttoT′t+1is a combination of technological shift due to ETCH and ITCH, i.e., shift in the production technology fromTttoTt+1is induced by the factors such as the general advancement in science and technology and the shift fromTt+1toT′t+1is due to the change in relative prices. Therefore, we obtain:(3)EFFCH=(b−a)TECH=(d−b)=((d−c)+(c−b))=ITCH+ETCHThus, EFFCH measures how close the observationais to the technologyTtand TECH measures the shift in the production technology.FollowingFäre et al. (2005), the directional output distance function is parameterized using a (additive) quadratic flexible functional form. In our case, with one good output (GDP =y), two bad outputs (CO2=b1and SO2=b2), three inputs (labor =x1, capital =x2, and energy =x3), a time trend and long-run oil prices, the particular functional form is (seeManagi et al. (2006)for alternative specification for multiple output stochastic production analysis):(4)Dkt(xkt,ykt,bkt;g,t,q)=α0+∑n=13αnxnkt+β1ykt+∑m=12βmbmkt+γ1t+γ2qt+12∑n=13∑n′=13αnn′xnktxn′kt+∑n=13δn1xnktykt+∑m=12∑n=13δnmxnktbmkt+∑n=13ηn1xnktt+∑n=13ηn2xnktqt+12β11yktykt+∑m=12β1myktbmkt+μy1yktt+μy2yktqt+12∑m=12∑m'=12βmm′bmktbm′kt+∑m=12μm1bmktt+∑m=12μm2bmktqt+12γ11t2+ϕtqt+12γ22qt2+ψGwithαnn′=αn′n;βmm′=βm′m;β1−∑m=12βm=−1;β1m−∑m=12βmm′=0;β11−∑m=12β1m=0;n=1,2,3;m=1,2andg= (1, −1), where 1 refers togyand −1 refers to −gb, wheretis a time trend,qis long-run oil prices, andGis a group dummy. The countries are grouped in two categories, developed and developing, based on per capita income following the World Bank classification.Specification(4)allows for neutral and biased TECH. The effect of neutral ETCH is captured by the coefficientsγ1andγ11and the effect of neutral ITCH is captured by the coefficients γ2and γ22. The extents of input-biased ETCH and ITCH is estimated by the coefficientsηn1andηn2, respectively. The effects of changes in output due to ETCH and ITCH (i.e., output biased TECH) are estimated by the coefficientsμy1, μm1, μy2and μm2, respectively. In addition, the interaction between ITCH and ETCH response is captured by the coefficientϕ.We parameterize the directional output distance function in quadratic form so that we are able to applyDiewert's (1976)Quadratic Identity Lemma.7Using this lemma, changes in the directional output distance function(4)from one period to the next can be written as:(5)(Dt−Dt+1)=0.5∂Dt∂y+∂Dt+1∂y(yt+1−yt)+0.5∑m=12∂Dt∂b+∂Dt+1∂b(bt+1−bt)+0.5∑n=13∂Dt∂xn+∂Dt+1∂xn(xnt+1−xnt)+0.5∂Dt+1∂t+∂Dt∂t+0.5∂Dt+1∂q+∂Dt∂q(qt−qt+1)whereDtis short forD(xt,yt,bt;g,t,q). Let PCH be the productivity index defined as:(6)PCH=−0.5−∂Dt+1∂y+−∂Dt∂y(yt+1−yt)+0.5∑m=12∂Dt∂b+∂Dt+1∂b(bt+1−bt)+0.5∑n=13∂Dt+1∂xn+∂Dt∂xn(xnt+1−xnt).This PCH index can be broadly defined as the difference of the weighted-average rates of change in outputs and inputs, where the weights are the derivatives of directional output distance function with respect to the (negative) good outputs and the (positive) bad outputs and inputs, respectively. Rearranging equation (6),PCHcan be decomposed as:(7)PCH=(Dt+1−Dt)︸EFFCH−0.5∂Dt+1∂t+∂Dt∂t︸ETCH−0.5∂Dt+1∂q+∂Dt∂q⋅(qt+1−qt)︸ITCH.Eq.(7)provides a meaningful decomposition of PCH into changes in EFFCH, ETCH, and ITCH. Negative values of the derivatives of the directional output distance function with respect to the time trend and the long-run oil prices imply a positive change in ETCH and ITCH, respectively. Therefore, the negative value of each component of the PCH productivity index implies a positive change in total factor productivity.8TECH, both exogenous and induced, can be further decomposed into two categories: changes associated with shifts in the transformation function and changes in output decisions regarding the production of a particular output from a change in relative prices along the new transformation function (Färe et al., 1997). The shift in the transformation function can be further subdivided into two categories: neutral TECH and biased TECH. Neutral TECH implies a shift in the technological frontier such that it becomes possible to produce fewer bad outputs and more good outputs with the same input quantities. Biased TECH implies the change in the slope of the frontier and the decision point of the firm is not on the ray, even when the relative prices are constant.This decomposition of TECH can be illustrated withFig. 1. Suppose a representative country uses some fixed quantity of inputs to produce GDP and sulfur emissions. Furthermore, assume that the country takes a decision at pointa, given technological possibilities represented byTt. Assume also that, at some timet+1, technological possibilities have improved, as represented by the shift of the frontier fromTttoTt+1. Accordingly, the production decision to be taken is situated at pointd.We can decompose the movement from pointsbanddinto the movements frombtod′, and fromd′ tod. Pointd′ is the point on the new frontier that does not lie on a ray. Hence, the movement frombtod′ represents a combination of biased and neutral technological change. The movement from pointbtodrepresents neutral technological progress and the movement fromd′ todmeasures the effect on the lesser production of SO2emissions between timetandt+ 1, referred to as bias in the production of outputs or biased TECH. The following Section2.3deals with the measurement of output and input biases in a directional output distance function.2.3. Output and input biasesAntle (1984)develops a profit-based multifactor measure of biased TECH. He defines the impact of technological progress on input decisions for factornas the proportionate change in the cost share of elasticity of factorndue to proportionate changes in the exogenous variables and long-run factor prices.One can derive the output supply functions as the derivative of the revenue function with respect to output prices. Similarly, we can derive the inverse of the output supply functions as the derivative of the directional output distance function with respect to the output quantities. The measures of output bias for exogenous and induced technological change can be expressed as follows.(8)εiε=−∂lnD∂lnyi/−∑i=13∂lnD∂lnyiBitE=∂ln(εi/ε)∂lntBitI=∂ln(εi/ε)∂lnqThe output bias associated with technological progress is:(9)ithoutputIncreasingNeutralReducingwhenBit>=<0whenforyi: GDP, CO2, SO2. We treat good and bad outputs asymmetrically. Therefore, a positive sign indicates GDP increasing (or augmenting) and emissions reducing (or saving) technological change. The input biases can be developed in a similar manner. That is, a positive sign indicates input decreasing and a negative sign indicates input increasing technological change.",Surender,Shunsuke,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 31, Issue 4, November 2009, Pages 334-353",79,unknown,male,,,,Mix

"1. IntroductionA polluting firm usually faces a choice between different abatement possibilities ranging from simple end-of-pipe technologies, that reduce emissions at the end of the production line, to highly complex clean technology systems that necessitate production process changes. Engineering studies normally show a range of feasible investment opportunities (with positive net present values), nevertheless, firms do not invest at the predicted level. Several explanations have been advanced to explain this apparent puzzle, including errors in the measurement of costs, heterogeneity in discount rates or, still, market failures (see for exampleHausman, 1979,Sutherland, 1991,Jaffe and Stavins, 1994).Here, we develop a structural approach to measure the impact of uncertainty in the future price of polluting fuel on a firm’s decision to invest in abatement technology. The proposed model will assume that the abatement investment is irreversible, since the equipment normally is firm-specific and has little re-sale value. Fuel use is a major source of air pollution and a rational firm facing environmental and energy taxation would normally consider both the pollution impact and any impact on the energy bill in deciding whether to undertake an abatement investment. Previous research on the U.S. steel industry, for example, showed that higher fuel prices had a significant positive impact on the decision to adopt fuel-saving technologies with a potential to reduce pollution(Boyd and Karlson, 1993).Choice of irreversible investment under uncertainty relates directly to the option value theoryMcDonald and Siegel, 1986,Dixit and Pindyck, 1994, which predicts that firms may delay investment because the value of waiting to resolve uncertainty exceeds the value of owning the asset during the waiting period. Several empirical applications of the option value theory of investment have been developed in order to explain the slow adoption of technologies that reduce emissions and the environmental impact of production.1Most of these use simulation techniques, though, and there are few ex post studies on investment data. The main contribution of this paper is to estimate hurdle rates2for abatement investments from a structural option value model, using ex post data from the Swedish energy and heating sector and pulp and paper industry.FollowingDixit and Pindyck (1994)we derive the threshold condition on the price of the polluting fuel for which a firm facing uncertainty will decide to invest in a new abatement technology. As inHarchaoui and Lasserre (2001), the proposed estimation procedure is based on the fact that this threshold condition holds at the time of the investment. WhereasHarchaoui and Lasserre (2001)provide a test of the option value theory in a more general framework, we instead measure hurdle rates for Swedish abatement investments under the assumption that the real option theory is relevant for all firms in our sample, and we discuss some of the potential policy implications of our results. We propose two approaches to measure hurdle rates: first, through direct computation of individual hurdle rates for each firm that has invested, second, through an econometric estimation that controls for random measurement error. Necessary data are firm characteristic data (such as fuel consumption, input prices, and output) before and after the investment took place as well as information on the actual capital costs of investment. The model is adapted to air pollution from fuel use and the econometric procedure is illustrated using a panel of firms from the Swedish pulp and paper industry, and the energy and heating sector and their SO2emissions from 2000 to 2003. The Swedish energy and heating sector is the primary fuel-consuming sector in Sweden, representing over 30% of total fuel consumption (in 2003), but the pulp and paper industry is also a major user of fuels (10% of total fuel consumption in 2003). Fuel costs account for around 20% of the sales value in the energy and heating sector, and 2% in the pulp and paper industry, on average, so the model’s assumption of the main uncertainty being the one surrounding the future price of polluting fuel is particularly relevant for the energy and heating sector, but is still of relevance for the pulp and paper industry. Over the period studied here, the Swedish pulp and paper industry and the energy and heating sector contributed to a high extent to industrial-source carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.3The results indicate that the presence of an option value due to uncertainty in the price of polluting fuel would multiply the standard hurdle rate for investment by a factor ranging from 2.7 to 3.1 in the pulp and paper industry, and from 3.4 to 3.6 in the energy and heating industry depending on econometric specification. We suggest future extensions of the model but argue that, although other explanations are possible, firms in these two sectors may delay adoption of irreversible abatement technologies because of uncertainty in the price of polluting fuel. We also find evidence that investment in abatement technologies has not induced a significant decrease in SO2emissions in any of the two sectors.We review the existing literature in Section2. Section3presents the theoretical model. The data and background are described in Section4. The econometric specification and the method we propose are described in Section5.

"2. Model2.1. Basic model descriptionWe develop a model of a game with several conservation agents (i) who choose how many and which discrete land parcels to conserve from a finite line of parcels subject to budget constraints. The agents face the same cost function for conservation but have potentially different benefit functions and budget constraints. A given agent seeks to maximize its net benefits subject to a budget constraint:(1)maxXiBi(Xi∪X−i)−C(Xi)=xi+∑j≠ixjαi+γb(Xi∪X−i)−βxis.t.βxi≤Miwherexiis the number of parcels agenticonserves,Xiis the set of particular parcels conserved by agenti,X−iis the set of particular parcels conserved by all agents other than agenti,αiis the shape parameter for the benefit function,Miis the budget endowment of agenti,βis the constant marginal cost of conserving parcels ∀i,bis the border between two adjacent conserved parcels andγis the constant marginal value of adjacency. The gross benefits to agentiof a pattern of conservation in the landscape are a function of total area conserved and adjacency values created by adjoining protected parcels.In our simplest models, the parcels are identical in their potential contribution to conservation benefits. The shape of the benefit function depends critically on the parameterα. Ifα< 1 we have diminishing marginal benefits from total area of conserved land, as from expanding an already large park. Ifα> 1, we have increasing marginal benefits from total area of conserved land, as when ecosystem functions increase disproportionately with area or contain thresholds. Agents may have heterogeneous values forα. The public-good nature of conservation benefits means that although the agents may not value conservation in the same way, each derives benefits from all of the parcels conserved in the landscape.In some of our simulations we capture benefits that derive from the spatial configuration of plots by allowing each agent to have a positive, negative, or zero valueγfor each ofbadjacencies between conserved plots. In this simple linear landscape, adjacency value captures a good portion of why we care about spatial configuration. For example, agglomerated conservation provides habitat to species that are sensitive to edge effects and provides recreation activities that cannot be had in smaller areas. In an example of negative adjacency value, urban planners who want to provide easily accessible open space across an area may prefer dispersed to agglomerated conservation; also, environmental organizations may want to have holdings that are spatially disjoint from other reserves in order to bolster public claims of uniqueness, or to avoid conflicts between heterogeneous management objectives.2Because net benefits are a function of what the other agents conserve, the agents’ decisions are interdependent and a game determines the equilibrium outcome of their individual decisions. We explore and compare several types of interactions between agents given full-information: noncooperative, sequential-move games resulting in Stackelberg equilibria; noncooperative, simultaneous-move games resulting in Nash equilibria; and a social optimum.2.2. Model solution methodsWe explore the results of some of these games analytically. Because analytical solutions cannot be determined when spatial configuration matters, we also use a MatLab program to solve for game equilibria on a line of parcels for a range of conservation agent types, interaction types, and cost/benefit parameters (Table 1). The landscape used for these numerical solutions contains seven parcels. Our games are played by two conservation agents, and each agent has only one turn in which to conserve land even when conserving more than one parcel. A pattern of conservationEis an equilibrium when:(2)B(XiE∪X−iE)αi−C(XiE)≥B(X′i∪X−iE)αi−C(X′i)∀X′iand∀iwhereX′irepresents another set of parcels for agenti. The condition simply says that each agent cannot find another set of parcels that, given the parcel set of the other agent, yields higher net benefits. The equality recognizes that multiple patterns generate the same net benefits.Table 1.

Multiple equilibria are common. In many cases, the potential for coordination failure arises. Instead of developing another layer of the game to choose among equilibria, we describe the types of equilibria that arise, determine the fraction of those equilibria that are similar to the social optimum, and describe the “bad” equilibria. In some cases, an equilibrium results from one agent playing a dominated strategy—that agent could do better by playing other strategies. Because experimental evidence suggests that, contrary to economists’ expectations, agents do sometimes play dominated strategies that result in an equilibrium (Cooper et al., 1990), we include these equilibria in our findings, and note the dominated nature of the underlying strategies when relevant.The first set of results describes the outcome of a game between a government agent and a land trust; the second set describes the outcome of a game between two land trusts in response to government policies. For both sets, we solve for the affiliated social optimum by assigning the sum of both agents’ funding to a single agent who seeks to maximize the social welfare function relevant to the case in hand, subject to that budget constraint. We then identify the socially optimal outcome by adapting the simulation code to have only one agent. When we model the government and a trust, we define the social welfare functionWAby assuming that the social planner has the same preferences as the government agent.(3)WA=Bg(Xg∪Xt)−C(Xg∪Xt)=(xg+xt)αg+γgb(Xg∪Xt)−β(xg+xt)In the second set of analyses, we define the social welfare function,WB, as the sum of the two trusts’ objective functions:(4)WB=∑i{Bi(Xi∪X−i)−C(Xi)}=((x1+x2)α1+(x1+x2)α2)+(γ1+γ2)b(X1∪X2)−β(x1+x2)In what follows, we compare all the Nash equilibria of the non-cooperative games to the solution to the social planner's optimization problem and to the value of the Nash equilibrium that yields the highest social welfare – the “best-case equilibrium outcome” (BCEO) – where the BCEO is typically lower than the maximized value of social welfare.",Heidi,Amy,Michael,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 30, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 492-508",47,female,female,male,,,Mix
"1. IntroductionMany private firms make a considerable effort to be, or at least to appear, socially responsible. They contribute to charity, invest in costly abatement equipment not mandated by law, and commit to ethical principles increasing their production costs, such as abstaining from the use of child labor in developing countries.2But why would a private firm pay extra costs to promote social values? If it does, will it not be wiped out of business by less responsible competitors?Corporate social responsibility is often explained by consumers’ willingness to pay for ethically produced goodsArora and Gangopadhyay, 1995,Björner et al., 2004; or by investors’ and/or entrepreneurs’ willingness to abstain from maximum profits to promote social valuesCullis et al., 1992,Baron, 2005. Other proposed explanations include pre-emption of new taxes or regulations(Maxwell et al., 2000), or signalling a “nice type” in order to get lenient treatment when new regulations are about to be introduced(Heyes, 2005a). While we acknowledge the relevance and importance of these explanations, we will disregard them below. Our focus will be, instead, on an issue hardly touched upon in the economics literature on corporate social responsibility, namely employee motivation.3The basic idea is simple: responsible employers attract responsible workers, who shirk less.For brevity, a socially responsible firm will be termed “green” below, while other firms are called “brown”. However, the main idea applies for corporate social responsibility in general, not just its environmental aspect. Let us explain the intuition of our argument in three steps.First, if some workers strictly prefer green employers, all else given, this may result in a lower equilibrium wage in green than in brown firms. Such a wage differential will keep green production in business, provided that green firms’ extra cleaning costs are offset by their lower wage payments. This is a very straightforward and almost trivial point, hardly requiring formal proof.4Nevertheless, the problem with this explanation is that workers’ willingness to pay for green employment would often have to be substantial: for green firms to be equally profitable as brown ones, workers in green firms essentially would have to share the entire cleaning cost between them. In practice, willingness to pay for green employment might not be that high.Assume, now, that individual effort is imperfectly observable. The second step in our argument is the following:ifthose workers who prefer green employment are also more likely to work hard, green firms’ productivity will be higher. Hence, green firms could survive in market equilibrium, even if workers’ willingness to pay for green employment is very modest.5Nevertheless, is it reasonable to expect a correlation between a preference for green employment and being hard-working? Our third step is to argue that this is, indeed, quite plausible. In fact, we will formalize one specific type of moral preferences, assume that the strength of this preference differs between individuals, and from this derive a perfect correlation between an individual’ effort at work and her willingness to pay for green employment.Our main result depends neither on this correlation to be perfect nor on its being derived from the particular moral principle that we propose. It does depend, however, on a correlation being present. A person who is very concerned about being responsible, or who enjoys making contributions to social welfare, will presumably derive satisfaction both from contributing to her firm’s productivity and to a greener society. Similarly, a person who is much bothered by bad conscience will probably be more reluctant both to shirk and take part in polluting production activities. A person of the Homo Oeconomicus type, on the other hand, will never work in green firms if the pay is lower; and she will definitely shirk if she can. More generally, such correlations arise naturally if moral satisfaction is not derived mechanically from having performing some uni-dimensional action, but is rather related to some morally relevant variable influenced bymanyactions; for example, the social welfare effects of one’s behavior. Then, the more an individual cares about being morally responsible, the higher is her concern for all behaviors affecting this morally relevant variable.Several existing studies indicate that moral choices are correlated in this way.Blanco et al. (2007)studied a sequential Prisoners’ Dilemma game and found that when the first mover had chosen to cooperate, the second mover’s choice was significantly correlated with the latter’s decisions in other games: the choice to cooperate was positively and significantly correlated with this individual’s contributions in a public good game, with her offers when playing the proposer in an Ultimatum Game, and also with her choice if playing the first mover in a sequential Prisoners’ Dilemma game.Altmann et al. (2007), using a modified version of the trust game, found a strong and positive relationship between a person’s generosity when playing the first mover and her tendency to repay others’ generosity when placed in the role of the second mover.Below, we will formalize the argument outlined above, using a specification of moral motivation which is close to that proposed inBrekke et al. (2003). We will demonstrate that if the strength of moral motivation varies between individuals, green firms can survive in equilibrium, even if workers’ willingness to pay for green employment is very small. More interestingly, if unobservable effort is sufficiently important for firm productivity,everybrown firm will be wiped out by competition; even if a substantial share of workers have no moral motivation whatsoever.6There is indeed some empirical evidence indicating that many people do prefer their employer to be socially responsible, and that they are willing to accept a lower wage to achieve this.Vitell and Davis (2004)found that job satisfaction was substantially higher when “top management was perceived as strongly supporting ethical behavior” (p. 493).Reinikka and Svensson (2003)found that religious non-profit primary health care facilities, providing more services with a public good element and charging lower prices than private for-profit facilities, hired qualified medical staff significantly below the market wage. The employer branding firm Universum collects responses from roughly 180,000 economics, business and technology students in 28 countries in its annual Graduate Survey, and one of their questions is: “Which of the following do you find most important when you select you future ideal employers?” In the 2006 US survey, 21.5% of respondents selected “corporate social responsibility”, while 39% selected “high ethical standards”; the corresponding European averages were 19.9 (CSR) and 21.1 (high ethical standards).7Frank (2003), using data for Cornell graduates and controlling for sex, curriculum, and academic performance, found a large and statistically significant compensating salary differential among recent Cornell graduates, with the jobs rated aslesssocially responsible earning substantiallyhigherwages.8Although we know of no other paper discussing corporate social responsibility as labor market screening, the problem of identifying and attracting individuals who are particularly highly motivated has been studied by several scholars. For example,Heyes (2005b)points out that if someone who derives satisfaction from a particular kind of work will also work hard at it, paying higher wages might attract less productive staff. He thus argues that increasing nurses’ wages might attract the ‘wrong sort’ of people into the nursing profession: as long as wages are low, only individuals with a vocation are attracted to the profession.9Similarly,Francois, 2000,Francois, 2007shows that public sector employees with ‘public service motivation’, i.e. a preference for a specific public good, may be willing to provide unobservable and unpaid effort to the extent that this increases the worker’s own access to the public good. Moreover, Francois shows that increasing public sector wages may attract the ‘wrong’, i.e. poorly motivated, workers.10Alger and Ma (2003)discuss optimal contracts between an insurer and a provider when the latter may be either of a “truthful” or a “collusive” type;Besley and Ghatak (2005)analyze matching of employers and employees with similar “mission” preferences.None of the above-mentioned authors analyze labor market screening in the context of corporate social responsibility. Our contribution is, firstly, to do precisely that. Secondly, we show how the idea of a “vocation” or a “public service motivation” can be derived endogenously from a general underlying principle of ethics.When cooperative behavior originates from such a general principle, this will affect different aspects of behavior in a correlated way. This, in turn, allows not only for reduced wage payments in green firms, but also for labor market screening. By becoming green, and at the same time reducing wages slightly, a firm will attract only those who have a high moral motivation; and those workers also shirk less. Even if a green firm keeps the same wage as the brown firms, its workers will, on average, be more productive than the workers of the brown firms, because those with high moral motivation will strictly prefer green employment.",Kjell,Karine,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 30, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 509-526",140,male,female,,,,Mix

"1. IntroductionThis paper explores two main issues. Firstly, we aim to demonstrate how optimal research and development effort, by improving total factor productivity with an uncertain rate of return, can help avoiding the limits to growth stemming from scarcity of nonrenewable resources. Secondly, we investigate the impact of technological uncertainty on the resource extraction rule, the R&D policy and the consumption trajectory at the optimum.At least since the series of seminal papers published in the Review of Economic Studies (Symposium on the Economics of Exhaustible Resources, 1974), it is now generally accepted that the limited supply of non-renewable resources does not necessarily imply a limit to growth (for example, seeDasgupta and Heal, 1974,Stiglitz, 1974,Solow, 1974). In particular, the neoclassical theory gives rise to three main possibilities: (i) substitution of the resource by other inputs such as capital, (ii) improvement of the resource efficiency and (iii) development of backstop technologies. However, without any technical change, none of these outcomes could balance the resource exhaustion and continue to sustain some positive growth in the long run. First, as pointed out bySmulders (2003), resource substitution for capital is limited in the long run because of the law of diminishing returns, which decreases the capital productivity with increasing scarcity of the resource.1Second, the improvement in efficiency may be the result of some accumulation of specific knowledge (or learning by doing). Third, alternative production processes would not be able to take place without a technological breakthrough.Most of the literature on non-renewable resources and technical advance considers that technological improvement takes place essentially through the development of a single backstop technology. Once it has been put in place, at a time that is generally endogenous, the backstop renders the exhaustible resource obsolete by producing a non-exhaustible perfect substituteDasgupta and Heal, 1974,Dasgupta and Stiglitz, 1981,Kamien and Schwartz, 1978. Another approach consists in considering a flow of innovations instead of a single backstop. In such a case, the resource remains a necessary input, but its productivity can be gradually improved by technical change since the flow of innovations allows for the accumulation of a specific knowledge asset that drives up the input productivity levels(Robson, 1980).2According to this approach, innovation arrival can be either continuous or discontinuous. Usually, new endogenous growth models consider a smoothed arrival of innovations over time, while the innovation itself can be seen as a time-continuous production function linking R&D effort positively with knowledge accumulation. Such innovations are called non-drastic innovations. However, the most significant, or drastic, innovations occur discontinuously, i.e. by “fits and starts”. In this case, technological progress should be viewed as a discontinuous incremental process.Helpman (1998)defines these drastic innovations as general purpose technologies (GPTs), and justifies their discontinuities by the fact that “a GPT has the potential to affect the entire economic system and can lead to far-reaching changes in such social factors as working hours and constraints on family life”. The present study is concerned with such drastic innovations in a non-renewable resource context, like for instance nuclear fusion process or hybrid motor vehicles.A second important aspect is that, when undertaking R&D activities, the economic agents do not know when and how many innovations will be developed. In reality, technical progress is far from predictable, hence uncertainty should be taken account since it is a determining factor in the drafting of research policy. When these two aspects are combined together, the jump process driving innovation arrivals becomes stochastic and is usually modelled by a Poisson process. While the literature on economic growth and Poison uncertainty is very extensive (e.g.Aghion and Howitt, 1998,Turnovsky, 1995, part IV,Steger, 2005,Wälde, 1999,Wälde, 2002), there are much fewer studies addressing both technological uncertainty and resource exhaustion issues. For instance,Just et al. (2005)investigate the impact on the depletion rate of an exogenous Poisson uncertainty in successive technology discoveries. They show that uncertainty causes the resource to be depleted more rapidly, due to the existence of sunk costs in the adoption of a new technology that create an incentive – an option value – to always delay current investments.The objective of this paper is twofold: (i) to investigate the effect of technological uncertainty on the optimal trajectories of the economy and (ii) to determine under which conditions an optimal growth path is sustainable. As in many neoclassical growth models with environmental considerations, sustainable growth is here defined as the way of achieving an unbounded growth trajectory, i.e. optimal feasible growth in which consumption, and then social welfare, is non-decreasing over time(Rodrigues et al., 2005). We carry out our analysis using a stochastic endogenous growth model á la Aghion–HowittAghion and Howitt, 1992,Aghion and Howitt, 1998,3with a non-renewable resource and assuming labor-consuming R&D, but without any capital accumulation (see alsoGrimaud and Rougé, 2003, for the deterministic approach of a Schumpetarian endogenous growth model with non-renewable resources). R&D outcomes are random and take place in discrete steps. Then, uncertainty influences both the timing and the number of innovation arrivals. Whenever R&D is successful, a technological shock will occur and the total factor productivity increases instantaneously. We use a time-dependent Poisson process to drive the innovation arrivals, since this is a standard method for modelling scarce and randomly occurring events. We also assume that this process is endogenous: the innovation arrival rate, i.e. the probability of R&D being successful, is positively affected by the R&D effort. The main findings are as follows. First, technological uncertainty reduces both the optimal research effort and the specific knowledge accumulation. Second, the resource extraction rate is increased if the relative risk aversion of consumers is less than unity, whereas it is decreased at higher aversion levels. Third, uncertainty increases optimal consumption in the short run and decreases it in the long run, whatever the shape of the corresponding path, except in a very restricted case where the marginal probability of success from R&D is very high and the social discount rate very small. Lastly, the economy will reach, on average, a sustainable growth path if the social discount rate is small enough compared with the marginal probability of success.This paper has the following structure. The model is described in Section2, while the optimal policy functions are derived in a CRRA specific analytical framework presented in Section3. We then characterize the optimal trajectories and compute the expected time-evolution of the variables. We also investigate the conditions under which, on average, the economy attains a sustainable growth path. In Section4, we apply a mean-preserving spread to the stochastic innovation process to analyze the effect of uncertainty on the optimal resource depletion scheme, the design of the optimal research policy and the level of optimal consumption.

"2. Previous treatments of multiple bounded uncertainty dataA MBU question is a combination of an ordinary payment card and the polychotomous choice question introduced byReady et al. (1995). In the MBU format respondents face multiple bids rather than one bid, as in a polychotomous choice question. The respondents are asked how likely an actual “yes-vote” would be by marking one of several verbal probability statements associated with each bid amount (e.g. “definitely yes”, “probably yes”, “unsure”, “probably no” or “definitely no”). TheXs’ inFig. 1illustrate the expected response pattern.Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The MB format (theXs’ illustrate a typical response pattern).In previous studies concerning the MBU format three different empirical approaches for analyzing such data have been suggested: (1) the seminal W&P approach; (2) the probability approach applied inEvans et al. (2003); and (3) the panel approach suggested inAlberini et al. (2003)andCameron et al. (2002).First, the W&P approach recodes the probabilistic answers (e.g., “probably yes” or “probably no”, etc.) into definite answers (“yes” or “no”). It follows that the MBU data converts to double-bounded WTP data which can be estimated with a discrete probability model. Underlying such recoding is an assumption concerning the real meaning of the probability statements (e.g. “probably yes” means “yes” and “unsure” means “no”). The results inWelsh and Poe (1998)showed, not surprisingly, that the median and mean WTP increased as weaker certainty levels were accepted as a “yes.” They also compared the estimates from different recodings of the MBU data to the estimates from other elicitation formats, all based on the same valuation scenario. It was found that theprobably yes modelproduced similar results as the payment card and the open-ended format, whereas the results from theunsure modelwere similar to the results elicited from the DC question.2The authors concluded that, given that the choice of elicitation format significantly influences the estimates of mean and median WTP, the MBU format has a practical advantage because it is possible to perform a sensitivity analysis of WTP with respect to uncertainty. We will explain the W&P approach in more detail in the next section and discuss some of its drawbacks.The second approach, suggested byEvans et al. (2003), assigns numerical probabilities to the subjective probability statements (e.g., “probably yes” means 75% chance of saying yes), and then creates an estimator that accommodates uncertainty on behalf of both the respondent and the researcher. This approach is potentially useful, but its weakness is its subjective translation of verbal statements into probabilities. To address this problem, they utilize behavioral research to interpret the probabilistic meaning of statements like “probably” and “maybe.” The precise meaning of such words is likely to differ between individuals, between goods and over time, which makes the mapping difficult and requires continuously updated interpretations. One alternative might be to ask the respondents themselves to translate the statements into probabilities, but this works against the main purpose and strength of the MBU format, which is to simplify the valuation task. If the individual is expected to know her WTP conditioned on a specific probability, why not ask for her expected WTP directly?The third empirical approach is the panel approach. By treating the MBU data as a panel it is possible to model the ordered structure of the data and estimate threshold values, showing at which average bid levels people switch from one uncertainty level to another. This method is an alternative way of performing the sensitivity analysis suggested byWelsh and Poe (1998). In previous MBU panel applications equal weights has been given to “definitely yes” and “probably no” responses in the estimation of the WTP distribution and, therefore, it will overestimate the mean and median WTP. The underlying problem with the panel approach is that the subjective interpretation of the probability statements is not reflected in the model, i.e. the different meaning of “definitely”, “probably” and “unsure” is not considered.Besides revealing information about response uncertainty,Alberini et al. (2003)suggested that the MBU format increases the efficiency of the WTP estimates compared to the DC and payment card formats. Indeed, such efficiency improvement will be present if the responses on successive bids for each individual are not perfectly dependent, i.e. if the correlation is less than one. If the correlation is less than one, the implication is that an individual's WTP changes throughout the “bidding process” (i.e. it is not obvious that respondents who answered “no” to $10 also will answer “no” to $100). As a consequence there is information not only in the switch from “yes” to “no” as in a payment card setting, but also in the response to all other bids.Alberini et al. (2003)found that the correlation was close to zero and estimated a random valuation function on the panel data.3Vossler and Poe (2005)argue against the result inAlberini et al. (2003)on both theoretical and empirical grounds. Theoretically, the correlation between responses to successive bids ought to be close to one. That is, there are no theoretical justifications for assuming that individuals “change their mind” through the bidding process. Using the same data as used inAlberini et al. (2003), they found that the correlation coefficient was close to one, indicating complete dependence, and therefore no efficiency improvement.Besides the methodological literature on the MBU format there are also a number of studies addressing robustness of the MBU estimates towards different designs of the MBU matrix (e.g.Roach et al., 2002,Alberini et al., 2003,Vossler et al., 2004). Since our objective is not to assess the validity of the MBU format we do not comment on these studies further.",Thomas,Runar,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 30, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 555-567",31,male,male,,,,Male

A consumer who does not purchase any product is assumed to have a surplus of zero.6There are two kinds of products on the market, which are respectively associated with a higher and a lower level of a unit of emission (hereafter, a dirtier and a cleaner product). Without loss of generality, we assume that foreign firmD(C) exports a product with a unit emission leveleD(eC) at pricepD(pC), andeD≥eC. We derive demand functions for the environmentally differentiated products. The index of the marginal consumer who is indifferent to the net surplus given by purchasing a dirtier and a cleaner product is given byθ˜=pC−pDeD−eC.Furthermore, the index of the marginal consumer who is indifferent between the net surplus given by purchasing a cleaner product and nothing is characterized byθˆ=v−pCeD. Thus, consumerθfalling into0≤θ<θ˜(θ˜<θ<θˆ)purchases a dirtier (cleaner) product. In addition, consumerθfalling intoθˆ<θ≤1purchases nothing in the market.7qD(qC) denotes quantity demanded for a dirtier (cleaner) product. Given the assumption of a uniform distribution, the demand functions are given by:(1)qD=θ˜=pC−pDeD−eCandqC=θˆ−θ˜=eD(v−pC)−eC(v−pD)eC(eD−eC).Second, let us characterize the foreign firms exporting the products associated with environmental qualities. The cost function is assumed to be a homogeneous function of degreeɛ≥ 2 as follows (Moraga-González and Padrón-Fumero, 2002, Assumption 2):(2)FD=αeD−εandFC=eC−ε.To avoid multiple equilibria in the decision game of unit emission levels, we assume that the cost functions are sufficiently asymmetric among these firms, i.e.,α> 1. Furthermore, to simplify, we assume that the marginal costs of production are independent of the unit emission level and are zero. Thus, the profit function of foreign firmiis given byπi=piqi−Fi,i=C,D.Third, we present the net social surplus included in social valuation of environmental damage. Hence, aggregate emissions that erode the environment are expressed as:(3)E=eDqD+eCqC.Furthermore, total consumer surplus is represented by:(4)CS=∫0θ˜(v−eDθ)dθ−pDqD+∫θ˜θˆ(v−eCθ)dθ−pCqC.Therefore, based on(3)and(4), the net social surplus is given by:(5)W≡CS−γE,where γ(≥0) is the marginal social valuation of environmental damage.",Tsuyoshi,None,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 30, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 578-584",6,male,,,,,Male

"1. IntroductionOne of the many risks associated with global warming is the possibility of a collapse in the thermohaline circulation (THC), which is one component of the meriodonal overturning circulation. The consequences of such a collapse are at present hard to estimate, but may include absolute and perhaps abrupt cooling near Greenland and NW Europe, tropical drying and various effects on ecosystems and species (Broecker, 1997,Vellinga and Wood, 2002,Wood et al., 2003). Rapid (decadal scale) changes in Greenland temperatures on the order of several degrees were associated with shutdown of the THC in the past, as indicated in ice core records. Association of THC shutdown with global scale climate changes is less clear in other paleo-climate records. The effect of THC changes on temperature arises from changes in the hydrological cycle at high latitudes, particularly higher precipitation and melting of land and sea ice, which reduce surface water density. Warming of surface waters also plays a role (Hemming, 2004).What effect future increases in CO2will have on the THC is uncertain. Whether the past provides a useful analogue is questionable due to the current absence of the large ice sheets of the past glacial epoch when the THC shutdown and abrupt climate changes occurred. Experiments with simplified, very large forcing, such as arbitrary increases in freshwater flux (“hosing”), can induce complete shutdown (seeManabe and Stouffer, 1995). In simplified models (Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity), increases in radiative forcing corresponding to levels anticipated for late in this century or early in the next can also cause shutdown of the circulation (Stocker and Scmittner, 1997). More realistic general circulation models running scenarios with gradually increasing radiative forcing usually exhibits a slowdown of the circulation within this century, although one respected model produces no such effect (Cubasch et al., 2001). General circulation model simulations with large perturbations such as may occur beyond the 21st Century show either slowdown or shutdown followed by recovery on a multi-century timescale or permanent collapse (Stouffer et al., 2006). Recent empirical investigations indicate that the THC may have already slowed but whether due to human-induced forcing or natural variation is unclear (Bryden et al., 2005).In summary, for the purposes of this paper we hypothesize that either the THC will “flicker”, and recover fully or partially in the course of centuries if for sufficient forcing, or the THC will shut down and remains shut down for millennia (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993,Stocker and Scmittner, 1997,Zickfeld et al., 2004,Rahmstorf, 1996). Here we will focus on the latter prospect. Simple models indicate that the THC collapse depends not only on the level of temperature caused by greenhouse gases, but also on how fast temperatures rise. If temperatures increases on average by, say 5 °C over 500 years, the THC may be sustained. However, if the same increase occurred over a century this could trigger a complete collapse. The reason is that both the temperature level and the rate of temperature change affect the budget of freshwater discharge in the North Atlantic, which is a critical component in how global warming affects the THC. The analysis in the cited papers strongly suggests that there are multiple threshold effects present in the dynamics of the THC. If temperature, temperature change or both become too high, a THC shutdown may result.The term ‘threshold’ as used in resource economic analysis has at least three interpretations. The first is related to the existence of Skiba points (or surfaces) in the Hamiltonian system that defines optimality conditions (Skiba, 1978). A second type is concerned with regulatory thresholds where regulatory action is triggered by certain variables such as return on some environmental asset (Conrad, 2000). The present paper examines a third type of threshold problem, which is concerned with physical shocks that occur when surfaces in state-space are crossed. Such shocks have been analyzed in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Deterministic analysis of one-dimensional thresholds with known location may be found inFarzin (1996)andNævdal, 2001,Nævdal, 2003. Here we consider the case where we do not know the location of the thresholds. Thresholds with unknown locations have been analyzed by, among others,Cropper (1976),Tsur and Zemel, 1995,Tsur and Zemel, 1996andNævdal (2003). To our knowledge, this literature on threshold effects is only concerned with the case where the threshold is one-dimensional, distributed along some subset of the real line.1The only exception, as far as we know, isNævdal (2006), which discusses a problem with a single multidimensional threshold. However, problems where there are several thresholds have as yet not been studied. The present paper adds to the economic toolkit by studying a problem where there are two thresholds distributed in two dimensions. The steps needed to generalize to a problem withkthresholds distributed inndimensions are straightforward.The type of risk management problem examined in this article may be categorized as catastrophic risk. There are two classes of catastrophic risk. Most of the literature analyzing this type of risk is concerned with catastrophic events distributed over time (see, e.g.Clark and Reed, 1994,Dasgupta and Heal, 1974). This literature has been extended to problems where the catastrophic risk is distributed in time but where the shape of the distribution depends on the path of the state-variables (Reed and Heras, 1992). In the present paper, as well as in the other articles that discuss the present type of thresholds, the events are distributed in state-space. The difference between an event distributed in time with a state-variable dependent distribution and an event distributed in state-space may appear inconsequential, but this turns out to not be the case. Technically, the difference is perhaps best appreciated by examining the hazard rate in the different cases.2The hazard rate for a time distributed problem will be a (possibly constant) function of time if state-variables are frozen at some particular value. Hazard rates in problems with state-space distributed events jump immediately to zero if state-variables are frozen. A good metaphor for state-space distributed risk is a person that is walking blindfolded towards a cliff. As long as the person is moving forwards there is a probability of going over the edge. If the person stops moving or retraces her, steps the probability of going over immediately jumps to zero. An example of time distributed risk would be a person standing on thawing ice carrying a number of weighty items. The probability of going through the ice depends on time as well as the weight. The person can control the hazard rate by reducing the weight, but as the ice is melting, the probability of going through the ice cannot be completely eliminated. The distinction between the two types is further discussed inTsur and Zemel (1998)where the two types are referred to as endogenous and exogenous risk and inNævdal, 2003,Nævdal, 2006where the thresholds are referred to as distributed in state-space as opposed to distributed in time. The key to solving the threshold problems is to recognize that state-variables are functions of time. The distributions of the thresholds can then be translated into a single distribution over time. After transforming the risk structure, threshold risk can be analyzed with the same tools as catastrophic events distributed over time.3The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section2describes the climate model and explains the risk structure imposed by multiple thresholds. Section3formalizes the risk structure and explains how it can be turned into a Poisson process suitable for optimal control models. In Section4optimality conditions are presented and some qualitative properties of optimal paths are derived. Section5summarizes the findings.",Eric,Michael,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 29, Issue 4, November 2007, Pages 262-283",24,male,male,,,,Male
"2. Asymmetric standards and green tariffsThe world consists of two regions: the North and the South. The North is assumed to enforce environmental standards through a tax on emissions released from production. The South in contrast has no environmental restrictions. Local as well as foreign firms can produce in the South with no extra costs for causing pollution.6The model assumes two firms, one belonging to each region. They produce a homogeneous good and compete in an oligopolistic manner à la Cournot. They compete in segmented markets and choose their optimal output for each market separately. Firms producing in the South are subject to a punishing tariff set on all dirty imports from the South, including re-exports of the Northern firm.7Firms are also capable of investing in pollution-abatement R&D to innovate cleaner production technologies and reduce their expenses on pollution tax.The Northern firm can choose its location for production. It can stay at home and serve both markets from its Northern headquarters. It can build a subsidiary in the South to have local access to the Southern market, but maintain domestic production to serve its home consumers. It can also close down home production altogether and delocate to serve both markets from the South. The Southern firm is assumed to only produce domestically.8Demand is assumed to be linear and takes the familiar form(1)pi=a−Qifori= N, S, whereQis the total consumption in each region, and subscripts N and S represent the North and the South. Total consumption in each region is(2)Qij=qii+qik,fori=N,S;k≠i;andj=E,F,D.The first subscript indicates the identity of the producer, while the second denotes the intended market. Superscript E represents the case where the firm produces only in the North and exports to the South, F when it undertakes FDI to serve the Southern market locally, and D when it completely delocates production and re-exports back to the North. The costs of production are divided between a non-pollution related production costc, which is assumed constant over firms and scales, and a unit pollution taxτpaid on emissions released from producing one unit of the good. The latter can be written as(3)eij=e0−xij,fori=N,S;j=E,F,Dwherex≤e02. Parametere0represents the basic unit emission prior to any pollution-abatement research, andxis the amount of R&D expenditure undertaken to innovate cleaner technologies.9R&D expenditure takes the form of a one-time investment and reduces emissions at a decreasing rate. The initial abatement of the dirtiest part of production requires less expenditure than efforts to further improve an already greener technology.The profit function for the Northern firm when all of its production takes place in the North is(4a)πNE=qNN(a−QNE−c−τeNE)+qNS(a−QSE−c−τeNE)−xNE.This entails a pollution tax on the entire production of the Northern firm. When the firm builds a subsidiary in the South, it only pays the tax on its domestic production:(4b)πNF=qNN(a−QNF−c−τeNF)+qNS(a−QSF−c)−xNF−Γ.ParameterΓrepresents the fixed cost of setting up a plant abroad which is independent of output. If the firm completely delocates production to the South, it avoids paying a pollution tax, but is bound to pay a green tariff on its exports back to the North:(4c)πND=qNN(a−QND−c−t)+qNS(a−QSD−c)−xND−Γ.The profits of the Southern firm are(5)πSj=qSN(a−QNj−c−t)+qSS(a−QSj−c)−xSj,forj=E,F,D,depending on the Northern firm's decision on production location. Recall that no environmental tax is enforced in the South, but a tariff is paid on exports to the North under all circumstances. Adopting backward induction, Section2.1first solves the problem of firms in the final stage where they compete in output.2.1. ProductionIn the export scenario where the multinational only produces at home, production by the two firms are10(6a)qNNE=1+t−2τeNE3,qSNE=1−2t+τeNE3,qNSE=1−2τeNE3,qSSE=1+τeNE3.for the Northern and the Southern market, respectively. Under FDI, the Northern firm maintains domestic production for its home market and serves the South through a local subsidiary. Output by each firm turns to(6b)qNNF=1+t−2τeNF3,qSNF=1−2t+τeN3,qNSF=qSSF=13,for each market. In the case of delocation, all production takes place in the South. Production by both firms becomes(6c)qNND=qSND=1−t3,qNSD=qSSD=13,for the North and the South, respectively.If the Northern firm produces at home for the domestic market, green tariffs have a direct effect of lowering imports from the South and increasing local production in the North. In other words, production moves to the region where environmental standards are respected. Stricter (Northern) standards per se have the reverse effect of reducing Northern production and thereby encouraging production by the Southern firm. When the Northern firm exports to the South,τaffects the entire production by both firms, whereas with FDI only goods targeted at the Northern market are influenced. Since both firms produce locally for the Southern market under FDI, they face no pollution tax. Thus, their optimal quantity produced resembles that of a typical Cournot case. Finally, if the firm completely closes down production in the North and establishes a plant in the South to serve both markets, pollution tax becomes irrelevant and green tariffs reduce exports by both firms to the North. No firm enjoys a production cost advantage in this case and the quantity produced by the two firms is equal.Result 1A green tariff discourages dirty imports from the South((∂qSNj/∂t)<0,forj= E, F),expanding production of the Northern firm for its homemarket((∂qNNj/∂t)>0,forj= E, F).Production hence shifts from a‘dirty’South to a‘clean’North, where environmental measures are respected.2.2. R&D investmentIn the second stage, firms decide their R&D expenditure, which is aimed at reducing emissions and cutting costs of production. Replacing the optimal outputs back into the corresponding profit functions and differentiating the latter with respect toxyields the optimal amount of R&D investment. If the multinational keeps all production at home, optimal R&D investment is(7a)xNE=2τ(2+t−4τe0)9−8τ22,where the conditiont> 2(2τe0− 1) must hold for R&D investment to take place. When the Northern firm partly moves production to the South, it invests(7b)xNF=2τ(1+t−2τe0)9−4τ22in R&D, where a more relaxed constraintt> 2τe0− 1 is required for a positive investment. Setting(7a)and(7b)equal and solving forτ, we find the threshold pollution tax rate below (above) which exporting (FDI) is associated with more R&D investment:(8)τ⌢=3(3e0−9e02−4t)4t.Finally, no R&D is undertaken if the Northern firm moves all production to the South to fully exploit the lack of environmental regulations:(7c)xND=0.Similarly, the Southern firm never engages in pollution-abatement (xSj=0forj=E, F, D) as there are no R&D incentives in the absence of a Southern pollution tax.Green tariffs affect R&D investment through the output for the Northern market, i.e.qNNandqSN. Since only imports from the South are subject to a green tariff, output for the Southern market (qNSandqSS) does not directly depend ont. First-order conditions of R&D investment in(7a)and(7b)with respect totshow that green tariffs always induce R&D efforts to innovate more environmentally friendly technologies. This is because green tariffs discourage dirty imports by the Southern firm (qSN), boosting local production in the North (qNN). A higher scale of production creates incentives for the Northern firm to make a larger one-time R&D investment to innovate a cleaner technology and cut its marginal costs of production (pay less emission tax). Green tariffs are inconsequential for R&D under delocation. It will be seen in the next section however, that a move from delocation to either FDI or export induces abatement by making R&D expenditure by the Northern firm positive.Result 2With exports and FDI,a higher scale of production in the North brought about by green tariffs induces the Northern firm to make a larger one-time investment in abatement R&D to cut its marginal expenses on pollution tax giving,i.e.(∂xNj/∂t)>0,forj= E, F.For industries that are not pollution intensive, R&D expenditure in the North has a monotonic increasing relation to the pollution tax because abatement is not costly andτonly has a marginal effect on production. For more pollution intensive industries, R&D has an inverted U-shape relation withτ. The pollution tax stimulates R&D, but also dampens production, which eventually overwhelms its encouragement of efforts to create a cleaner technology. The burden of pollution tax on production is heavier the higher are basic unit emissionse0. As a result, abatement R&D is decreasing ine0for givenτandt. Namely,(∂xNj/∂e0)<0forj=E, F is true for all positive values of R&D investment in(7a)and(7b).2.3. Output constraintsTo find the optimal output for each case, we substitute optimal R&D investment from(7a),(7b)and(7c)back into the quantity produced in(6a),(6b)and(6c). Optimal output by each firm is derived for exports, FDI and delocation inTable 1. The limits on production have different implications for each segment of the market and can be solved for by setting the respective output equal to zero as follows.Table 1. Optimal outputEmpty CellqNNqSNqNSqSSE9(1−2τe0+t)−4τ2t3(9−8τ2)9(1+τe0−2t)−2τ2(6−7t)3(9−8τ2)9(1−2τe0)+4τ2t3(9−8τ2)9(1+τe0)−2τ2(6+t)3(9−8τ2)F3(1−2τe0+t)9−4τ23(1+τe0−2t)−2τ2(1−t)9−4τ21313D1−t31−t31313For the Northern firm to produce domestically for its home market (qNNj>0forj=N, S), pollution standards in the North must be under a critical valueτ<(3(9e02+4t[1+t]−3e0)/4t)orτ<((1+t)/2e0)for the export and the FDI case, respectively. A higher pollution tax in the North creates a very large cost advantage for the Southern firm making it unprofitable for the Northern firm to serve its home market.11Also, under exportsτ<(3(3e0−9e02−4t)/4t)must hold for the Northern firm to continue exporting to the South (qNSE>0). Comparing this constraint toτ⌢in Eq.(8)reveals that they are equal. This indicates that as long asτis in a feasible range for the North to maintain its exports to the South, exporting results in higher pollution-abatement R&D than FDI.Lemma 1When exporting is a feasible option(τ<τ⌢⇔qNSE>0),it always results in more R&D effort by the Northern firm than FDI(xNE>xNF).UsingLemma 1in(3), it immediately follows thateNE>eNF. Therefore, Eqs.(6a)and(6b)show that for a giventandτthe Northern (Southern) firm's output for the Northern market is also higher (lower) under exports than FDI (qNNE>qNNF,qSNE<qSNF). On the contrary, an emission tax burden on exports to the South causes the Northern (Southern) firm to produce a lower (higher) output with respect to FDI (qNSE<qNSF,qSSE>qSSF). The direct negative effect of a unilateral tax on the Northern firm always dominates its indirect positive affect on the Southern firm asqNSE+qSSE=((9(2−τe0)−2τ2(6−t))/3(9−8τ2))≤qNSF+qSSF=2/3. Exporting thus results in a lower total production for the Southern market than FDI.Lemma 2The Northern firm's domestic market share is higher(qNNE>qNNF,qSNE<qSNF)and its share in the foreign market lower(qNSE<qNSF,qSSE>qSSF)under exports than FDI.Total production aimed at the South is also lower under exports(qNSE+qSSE≤qNSF+qSSF).There also exists a prohibitive green tariff at which the Southern firm ceases its exports to the North (qSNj=0forj=E, F). The prohibitive tariff rates are(9)tˆE=3[3(1+τe0)−4τ2]2(9−7τ2),tˆF=3(1+τe0)−2τ22(3−τ2),for the export and the FDI case, respectively. This threshold value oftstops the importation of all dirty products to the North by blocking trade, and gives the Northern firm a monopoly position in its home market.122.4. LocationIn the first stage of the game, the Northern multinational chooses a location for serving each market. To find the optimal outcome on location, we must replace the optimal outputs along with the optimal R&D back into the Northern firm's profit functions in(4a),(4b)and(4c)and compare the profitability of each option. Northern profits become(10a)πNE=qNNE(t,τ)2+qNSE(t,τ)2−xNE(t,τ),πNF=qNNF(t,τ)2+(qNSF)−2xNF(t,τ)−Γ,πND=qNND(t)2+(qNSD)−2Γ,using equations(7a)and(7b), andTable 1for the optimal R&D and outputs. We can now compare profits to find the location that yields the highest gains.We start by looking at the decision of the Northern firm on whether to serve the South through exports or an extra plant in the South. FDI avoids pollution costs on production at the South and results in lower R&D expenditure. If these outweigh the fixed costs of relocation and the lower domestic production associated with FDI, the latter prevails. Exporting thus occurs when plant-specific fixed costs, or other fixed costs such as inflexible foreign investment laws or political instability in the host country are high; namely whenΓ=Γ¯≥4τ(8τ3−4t2τ3+36tτ2e0−18tτ−27τ−81τe02+81e0)9(9−4τ2)(9−8τ2),which givesπNE≥πNF. ThresholdΓ¯depends very little ontbecause a green tariff affects profits under both situations in a similar manner.13They directly raise home production and only indirectly affect Northern exports to the South through changes in R&D investment. The main difference between exporting and FDI is that in the former the Northern firm incurs a pollution tax on its production for the South. Therefore, small values ofτalong with large fixed costs of relocation make exporting more profitable. Adding bilateral trade costs to the model only affects the exporting scenario and the dividing line between the latter and FDI. Lower trade costs simply increase the likelihood of exporting by making it more profitable.Next, we compare FDI with delocation to see whether the Northern firm prefers to serve its home market by producing domestically or by delocating and re-exporting back to the North. Clearly, a higher pollution tax in the North makes delocation more attractive, while a green tariff encourages FDI. The threshold green tariff rate, which deters delocation, is thetthat makes profits under the two options equal (πNF=πND):(11)t¯=1−32τ2(1−τe0)(3−9−4τ2).The first-order condition of(11)gives(∂t¯/∂τ)>0, which implies that higher green tariffs succeed to dissuade delocation for a larger range ofτ. In other words, tougher standards in the North require a higher green tariff on dirty goods from the South to impede delocation. Such punishing tariffs hence can be deemed ‘green’ for a third reason that they discourage delocation to pollution havens, which in turn induces a positive investment in pollution-abatement R&D (as opposed to zero) by the Northern firm.Result 3Green tariffs discourage delocation to the South.This compels the Northern firm to pay the home pollution tax,which in turn creates a positive R&D investment for abatement(xNF>xND=0).Fig. 1shows the decision of the Northern firm on location in the presence of positive fixed costs for a pollution intensity ofe0= 1. It can be seen that exporting is the mode of choice for serving the South when pollution tax in the North is sufficiently low. The figure shows a case, whereΓ= 0.05. A higher fixed cost of relocation simply expands the export region. A high emission tax rate at home tempts the Northern firm to relocate production to the South. Fort<t¯the Northern firm completely delocates, whereas fort>t¯it builds a subsidiary to serve each market locally to partly jump its pollution tax expenses and avoid green tariffs. A largere0shifts the cone within which both firms produce to the left, while a smallere0lowers it to the right. This is because a lower tax burden related to lower pollution intensity makes it easier for the Northern firm to maintain production at home. Also, the Southern firm enjoys a lower cost advantage in cleaner industries. Lower pollution intensity also tilts thet¯curve downwards, decreasing the incentives to delocate ((∂t¯/δe0)>0). In other words, the more pollution intensive is the industry, the higher is the green tariff required to block delocation.Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Location of the multinational.Finally, the decision between exporting and delocation is derived in the same manner by finding the emission tax ceiling under which exporting is chosen (πE=πD):τ¯=3(3e0(2−t)+[(2−t)2−18Γ][9(e02−Γ)−4t])2[(2−t)2+18(e02−Γ)].This critical emission tax rate that divides exporting from delocation is shown with a thick line inFig. 1. Note that trade liberalization, even in the absence of environmental harmonization, does not necessarily cause delocation to pollution havens.14This is true as long as the fixed costs of relocation are positive andτ≤τ¯.",Alireza,None,None,None,None,Resource and Energy Economics,"Volume 29, Issue 4, November 2007, Pages 284-299",4,unknown,,,,,Mix
